description: "The Rose and The Ring is a satirical work of fantasy fiction written\
  \ by William Makepeace Thackeray, originally published at Christmas 1854 (though\
  \ dated 1855). It criticises, to some extent, the attitudes of the monarchy and\
  \ those at the top of society and challenges their ideals of beauty and marriage.\n\
  Set in the fictional countries of Paflagonia and Crim Tartary, the story revolves\
  \ around the lives and fortunes of four young royal cousins, Princesses Angelica\
  \ and Rosalba, and Princes Bulbo and Giglio. Each page is headed by a line of poetry\
  \ summing up the plot at that point and the storyline as a whole is laid out, as\
  \ the book states, as \"A Fireside Pantomime\". The original edition had illustrations\
  \ by Thackeray who had once intended a career as an illustrator.\n From Wikipedia\
