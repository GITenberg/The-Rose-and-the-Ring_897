    <h2>
      PRELUDE
    </h2>
    <p>
      It happened that the undersigned spent the last Christmas season in a
      foreign city where there were many English children.
    </p>
    <p>
      In that city, if you wanted to give a child&rsquo;s party, you could not even
      get a magic-lantern or buy Twelfth-Night characters&mdash;those funny
      painted pictures of the King, the Queen, the Lover, the Lady, the Dandy,
      the Captain, and so on&mdash;with which our young ones are wont to
      recreate themselves at this festive time.
    </p>
    <p>
      My friend Miss Bunch, who was governess of a large family that lived in
      the Piano Nobile of the house inhabited by myself and my young charges (it
      was the Palazzo Poniatowski at Rome, and Messrs. Spillmann, two of the
      best pastrycooks in Christendom, have their shop on the ground floor):
      Miss Bunch, I say, begged me to draw a set of Twelfth-Night characters for
      the amusement of our young people.
    </p>
    <p>
      She is a lady of great fancy and droll imagination, and having looked at
      the characters, she and I composed a history about them, which was recited
      to the little folks at night, and served as our FIRESIDE PANTOMIME.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our juvenile audience was amused by the adventures of Giglio and Bulbo,
      Rosalba and Angelica. I am bound to say the fate of the Hall Porter
      created a considerable sensation; and the wrath of Countess Gruffanuff was
      received with extreme pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      If these children are pleased, thought I, why should not others be amused
      also? In a few days Dr. Birch&rsquo;s young friends will be expected to
      reassemble at Rodwell Regis, where they will learn everything that is
      useful, and under the eyes of careful ushers continue the business of
      their little lives.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, in the meanwhile, and for a brief holiday, let us laugh and be as
      pleasant as we can. And you elder folk&mdash;a little joking, and dancing,
      and fooling will do even you no harm. The author wishes you a merry
      Christmas, and welcomes you to the Fireside Pantomime.
    </p>
    <p>
      W. M. THACKERAY. December 1854.

    <h2>
      I. SHOWS HOW THE ROYAL FAMILY SATE DOWN TO BREAKFAST
    </h2>
    <p>
      This is Valoroso XXIV., King of Paflagonia, seated with his Queen and only
      child at their royal breakfast-table, and receiving the letter which
      announces to His Majesty a proposed visit from Prince Bulbo, heir of
      Padella, reigning King of Crim Tartary. Remark the delight upon the
      monarch&rsquo;s royal features. He is so absorbed in the perusal of the King of
      Crim Tartary&rsquo;s letter, that he allows his eggs to get cold, and leaves his
      august muffins untasted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What! that wicked, brave, delightful Prince Bulbo!&rsquo; cries Princess
      Angelica; &lsquo;so handsome, so accomplished, so witty&mdash;the conqueror of
      Rimbombamento, where he slew ten thousand giants!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Who told you of him, my dear?&rsquo; asks His Majesty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A little bird,&rsquo; says Angelica.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Poor Giglio!&rsquo; says mamma, pouring out the tea.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Bother Giglio!&rsquo; cries Angelica, tossing up her head, which rustled with a
      thousand curl-papers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I wish,&rsquo; growls the King&mdash;&lsquo;I wish Giglio was. . .&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Was better? Yes, dear, he is better,&rsquo; says the Queen. &lsquo;Angelica&rsquo;s little
      maid, Betsinda, told me so when she came to my room this morning with my
      early tea.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are always drinking tea,&rsquo; said the monarch, with a scowl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is better than drinking port or brandy and water;&rsquo; replies Her
      Majesty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, well, my dear, I only said you were fond of drinking tea,&rsquo; said the
      King of Paflagonia, with an effort as if to command his temper. &lsquo;Angelica!
      I hope you have plenty of new dresses; your milliners&rsquo; bills are long
      enough. My dear Queen, you must see and have some parties. I prefer
      dinners, but of course you will be for balls. Your everlasting blue velvet
      quite tires me: and, my love, I should like you to have a new necklace.
      Order one. Not more than a hundred or a hundred and fifty thousand
      pounds.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And Giglio, dear?&rsquo; says the Queen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;GIGLIO MAY GO TO THE&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, sir,&rsquo; screams Her Majesty. &lsquo;Your own nephew! our late King&rsquo;s only
      son.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Giglio may go to the tailor&rsquo;s, and order the bills to be sent in to
      Glumboso to pay. Confound him! I mean bless his dear heart. He need want
      for nothing; give him a couple of guineas for pocket-money, my dear; and
      you may as well order yourself bracelets while you are about the necklace,
      Mrs. V.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Her Majesty, or MRS. V., as the monarch facetiously called her (for even
      royalty will have its sport, and this august family were very much
      attached), embraced her husband, and, twining her arm round her daughter&rsquo;s
      waist, they quitted the breakfast-room in order to make all things ready
      for the princely stranger.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they were gone, the smile that had lighted up the eyes of the HUSBAND
      and FATHER fled&mdash;the pride of the KING fled&mdash;the MAN was alone.
      Had I the pen of a G. P. R. James, I would describe Valoroso&rsquo;s torments in
      the choicest language; in which I would also depict his flashing eye, his
      distended nostril&mdash;his dressing-gown, pocket-handkerchief, and boots.
      But I need not say I have NOT the pen of that novelist; suffice it to say,
      Valoroso was alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      He rushed to the cupboard, seizing from the table one of the many egg-cups
      with which his princely board was served for the matin meal, drew out a
      bottle of right Nantz or Cognac, filled and emptied the cup several times,
      and laid it down with a hoarse &lsquo;Ha, ha, ha! now Valoroso is a man again!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But oh!&rsquo; he went on (still sipping, I am sorry to say), &lsquo;ere I was a
      king, I needed not this intoxicating draught; once I detested the hot
      brandy wine, and quaffed no other fount but nature&rsquo;s rill. It dashes not
      more quickly o&rsquo;er the rocks than I did, as, with blunderbuss in hand, I
      brushed away the early morning dew, and shot the partridge, snipe, or
      antlered deer! Ah! well may England&rsquo;s dramatist remark, &ldquo;Uneasy lies the
      head that wears a crown!&rdquo; Why did I steal my nephew&rsquo;s, my young Giglio&rsquo;s&mdash;?
      Steal! said I? no, no, no, not steal, not steal. Let me withdraw that
      odious expression. I took, and on my manly head I set, the royal crown of
      Paflagonia; I took, and with my royal arm I wield, the sceptral rod of
      Paflagonia; I took, and in my outstretched hand I hold, the royal orb of
      Paflagonia! Could a poor boy, a snivelling, drivelling boy&mdash;was in
      his nurse&rsquo;s arms but yesterday, and cried for sugarplums and puled for pap&mdash;bear
      up the awful weight of crown, orb, sceptre? gird on the sword my royal
      fathers wore, and meet in fight the tough Crimean foe?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      And then the monarch went on to argue in his own mind (though we need not
      say that blank verse is not argument) that what he had got it was his duty
      to keep, and that, if at one time he had entertained ideas of a certain
      restitution, which shall be nameless, the prospect by a CERTAIN MARRIAGE
      of uniting two crowns and two nations which had been engaged in bloody and
      expensive wars, as the Paflagonians and the Crimeans had been, put the
      idea of Giglio&rsquo;s restoration to the throne out of the question: nay, were
      his own brother, King Savio, alive, he would certainly will the crown from
      his own son in order to bring about such a desirable union.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus easily do we deceive ourselves! Thus do we fancy what we wish is
      right! The King took courage, read the papers, finished his muffins and
      eggs, and rang the bell for his Prime Minister. The Queen, after thinking
      whether she should go up and see Giglio, who had been sick, thought &lsquo;Not
      now. Business first; pleasure afterwards. I will go and see dear Giglio
      this afternoon; and now I will drive to the jeweller&rsquo;s, to look for the
      necklace and bracelets.&rsquo; The Princess went up into her own room, and made
      Betsinda, her maid, bring out all her dresses; and as for Giglio, they
      forgot him as much as I forget what I had for dinner last Tuesday
      twelve-month.

    <h2>
      II. HOW KING VALOROSO GOT THE CROWN, AND PRINCE GIGLIO WENT WITHOUT
    </h2>
    <p>
      Paflagonia, ten or twenty thousand years ago, appears to have been one of
      those kingdoms where the laws of succession were not settled; for when
      King Savio died, leaving his brother Regent of the kingdom, and guardian
      of Savio&rsquo;s orphan infant, this unfaithful regent took no sort of regard of
      the late monarch&rsquo;s will; had himself proclaimed sovereign of Paflagonia
      under the title of King Valoroso XXIV., had a most splendid coronation,
      and ordered all the nobles of the kingdom to pay him homage. So long as
      Valoroso gave them plenty of balls at Court, plenty of money and lucrative
      places, the Paflagonian nobility did not care who was king; and as for the
      people, in those early times, they were equally indifferent. The Prince
      Giglio, by reason of his tender age at his royal father&rsquo;s death, did not
      feel the loss of his crown and empire. As long as he had plenty of toys
      and sweetmeats, a holiday five times a week and a horse and gun to go out
      shooting when he grew a little older, and, above all, the company of his
      darling cousin, the King&rsquo;s only child, poor Giglio was perfectly
      contented; nor did he envy his uncle the royal robes and sceptre, the
      great hot uncomfortable throne of state, and the enormous cumbersome crown
      in which that monarch appeared from morning till night. King Valoroso&rsquo;s
      portrait has been left to us; and I think you will agree with me that he
      must have been sometimes RATHER TIRED of his velvet, and his diamonds, and
      his ermine, and his grandeur. I shouldn&rsquo;t like to sit in that stifling
      robe with such a thing as that on my head.
    </p>
    <p>
      No doubt, the Queen must have been lovely in her youth; for though she
      grew rather stout in after life, yet her features, as shown in her
      portrait, are certainly PLEASING. If she was fond of flattery, scandal,
      cards, and fine clothes, let us deal gently with her infirmities, which,
      after all, may be no greater than our own. She was kind to her nephew; and
      if she had any scruples of conscience about her husband&rsquo;s taking the young
      Prince&rsquo;s crown, consoled herself by thinking that the King, though a
      usurper, was a most respectable man, and that at his death Prince Giglio
      would be restored to his throne, and share it with his cousin, whom he
      loved so fondly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Prime Minister was Glumboso, an old statesman, who most cheerfully
      swore fidelity to King Valoroso, and in whose hands the monarch left all
      the affairs of his kingdom. All Valoroso wanted was plenty of money,
      plenty of hunting, plenty of flattery, and as little trouble as possible.
      As long as he had his sport, this monarch cared little how his people paid
      for it: he engaged in some wars, and of course the Paflagonian newspapers
      announced that he had gained prodigious victories: he had statues erected
      to himself in every city of the empire; and of course his pictures placed
      everywhere, and in all the print-shops: he was Valoroso the Magnanimous,
      Valoroso the Victorious, Valoroso the Great, and so forth;&mdash;for even
      in these early times courtiers and people knew how to flatter.
    </p>
    <p>
      This royal pair had one only child, the Princess Angelica, who, you may be
      sure, was a paragon in the courtiers&rsquo; eyes, in her parents&rsquo;, and in her
      own. It was said she had the longest hair, the largest eyes, the slimmest
      waist, the smallest foot, and the most lovely complexion of any young lady
      in the Paflagonian dominions. Her accomplishments were announced to be
      even superior to her beauty; and governesses used to shame their idle
      pupils by telling them what Princess Angelica could do. She could play the
      most difficult pieces of music at sight. She could answer any one of
      Mangnall&rsquo;s Questions. She knew every date in the history of Paflagonia,
      and every other country. She knew French, English, Italian, German,
      Spanish, Hebrew, Greek, Latin, Cappadocian, Samothracian, Aegean, and Crim
      Tartar. In a word, she was a most accomplished young creature; and her
      governess and lady-in-waiting was the severe Countess Gruffanuff.
    </p>
    <p>
      Would you not fancy, from this picture, that Gruffanuff must have been a
      person of highest birth? She looks so haughty that I should have thought
      her a princess at the very least, with a pedigree reaching as far back as
      the Deluge. But this lady was no better born than many other ladies who
      give themselves airs; and all sensible people laughed at her absurd
      pretensions. The fact is, she had been maid-servant to the Queen when Her
      Majesty was only Princess, and her husband had been head footman; but
      after his death or DISAPPEARANCE, of which you shall hear presently, this
      Mrs. Gruffanuff, by flattering, toadying, and wheedling her royal
      mistress, became a favourite with the Queen (who was rather a weak woman),
      and Her Majesty gave her a title, and made her nursery governess to the
      Princess.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now I must tell you about the Princess&rsquo;s learning and accomplishments,
      for which she had such a wonderful character. Clever Angelica certainly
      was, but as IDLE as POSSIBLE. Play at sight, indeed! she could play one or
      two pieces, and pretend that she had never seen them before; she could
      answer half a dozen Mangnall&rsquo;s Questions; but then you must take care to
      ask the RIGHT ones. As for her languages, she had masters in plenty, but I
      doubt whether she knew more than a few phrases in each, for all her
      presence; and as for her embroidery and her drawing, she showed beautiful
      specimens, it is true, but WHO DID THEM?
    </p>
    <p>
      This obliges me to tell the truth, and to do so I must go back ever so
      far, and tell you about the FAIRY BLACKSTICK.

    <h2>
      III. TELLS WHO THE FAIRY BLACKSTICK WAS, AND WHO WERE EVER SO MANY GRAND
      PERSONAGES BESIDES
    </h2>
    <p>
      Between the kingdoms of Paflagonia and Crim Tartary, there lived a
      mysterious personage, who was known in those countries as the Fairy
      Blackstick, from the ebony wand or crutch which she carried; on which she
      rode to the moon sometimes, or upon other excursions of business or
      pleasure, and with which she performed her wonders.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she was young, and had been first taught the art of conjuring by the
      necromancer, her father, she was always practicing her skill, whizzing
      about from one kingdom to another upon her black stick, and conferring her
      fairy favours upon this Prince or that. She had scores of royal
      godchildren; turned numberless wicked people into beasts, birds,
      millstones, clocks, pumps, boot jacks, umbrellas, or other absurd shapes;
      and, in a word, was one of the most active and officious of the whole
      College of fairies.
    </p>
    <p>
      But after two or three thousand years of this sport, I suppose Blackstick
      grew tired of it. Or perhaps she thought, &lsquo;What good am I doing by sending
      this Princess to sleep for a hundred years? by fixing a black pudding on
      to that booby&rsquo;s nose? by causing diamonds and pearls to drop from one
      little girl&rsquo;s mouth, and vipers and toads from another&rsquo;s? I begin to think
      I do as much harm as good by my performances. I might as well shut my
      incantations up, and allow things to take their natural course.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There were my two young goddaughters, King Savio&rsquo;s wife, and Duke
      Padella&rsquo;s wife, I gave them each a present, which was to render them
      charming in the eyes of their husbands, and secure the affection of those
      gentlemen as long as they lived. What good did my Rose and my Ring do
      these two women? None on earth. From having all their whims indulged by
      their husbands, they became capricious, lazy, ill-humoured, absurdly vain,
      and leered and languished, and fancied themselves irresistibly beautiful,
      when they were really quite old and hideous, the ridiculous creatures!
      They used actually to patronise me when I went to pay them a visit&mdash;ME,
      the Fairy Blackstick, who knows all the wisdom of the necromancers, and
      could have turned them into baboons, and all their diamonds into strings
      of onions, by a single wave of my rod!&rsquo; So she locked up her books in her
      cupboard, declined further magical performances, and scarcely used her
      wand at all except as a cane to walk about with.
    </p>
    <p>
      So when Duke Padella&rsquo;s lady had a little son (the Duke was at that time
      only one of the principal noblemen in Crim Tartary), Blackstick, although
      invited to the christening, would not so much as attend; but merely sent
      her compliments and a silver papboat for the baby, which was really not
      worth a couple of guineas. About the same time the Queen of Paflagonia
      presented His Majesty with a son and heir; and guns were fired, the
      capital illuminated, and no end of feasts ordained to celebrate the young
      Prince&rsquo;s birth. It was thought the fairy, who was asked to be his
      godmother, would at least have presented him with an invisible jacket, a
      flying horse, a Fortunatus&rsquo;s purse, or some other valuable token of her
      favour; but instead, Blackstick went up to the cradle of the child Giglio,
      when everybody was admiring him and complimenting his royal papa and
      mamma, and said, &lsquo;My poor child, the best thing I can send you is a little
      MISFORTUNE&rsquo;; and this was all she would utter, to the disgust of Giglio&rsquo;s
      parents, who died very soon after, when Giglio&rsquo;s uncle took the throne, as
      we read in Chapter I.
    </p>
    <p>
      In like manner, when CAVOLFIORE, King of Crim Tartary, had a christening
      of his only child, ROSALBA, the Fairy Blackstick, who had been invited,
      was not more gracious than in Prince Giglio&rsquo;s case. Whilst everybody was
      expatiating over the beauty of the darling child, and congratulating its
      parents, the Fairy Blackstick looked very sadly at the baby and its
      mother, and said, &lsquo;My good woman (for the Fairy was very familiar, and no
      more minded a Queen than a washerwoman)&mdash;my good woman, these people
      who are following you will be the first to turn against you; and as for
      this little lady, the best thing I can wish her is a LITTLE MISFORTUNE.&rsquo; 
      So she touched Rosalba with her black wand, looked severely at the
      courtiers, motioned the Queen an adieu with her hand, and sailed slowly up
      into the air out of the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she was gone, the Court people, who had been awed and silent in her
      presence, began to speak. &lsquo;What an odious Fairy she is (they said)&mdash;a
      pretty Fairy, indeed! Why, she went to the King of Paflagonia&rsquo;s
      christening, and pretended to do all sorts of things for that family; and
      what has happened&mdash;the Prince, her godson, has been turned off his
      throne by his uncle. Would we allow our sweet Princess to be deprived of
      her rights by any enemy? Never, never, never, never!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      And they all shouted in a chorus, &lsquo;Never, never, never, never!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, I should like to know, and how did these fine courtiers show their
      fidelity? One of King Cavolfiore&rsquo;s vassals, the Duke Padella just
      mentioned, rebelled against the King, who went out to chastise his
      rebellious subject. &lsquo;Any one rebel against our beloved and august
      Monarch!&rsquo; cried the courtiers; &lsquo;any one resist HIM? Pooh! He is
      invincible, irresistible. He will bring home Padella a prisoner, and tie
      him to a donkey&rsquo;s tail, and drive him round the town, saying, &ldquo;This is the
      way the Great Cavolfiore treats rebels.&rdquo;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The King went forth to vanquish Padella; and the poor Queen, who was a
      very timid, anxious creature, grew so frightened and ill that I am sorry
      to say she died; leaving injunctions with her ladies to take care of the
      dear little Rosalba.&mdash;Of course they said they would. Of course they
      vowed they would die rather than any harm should happen to the Princess.
      At first the Crim Tartar Court Journal stated that the King was obtaining
      great victories over the audacious rebel: then it was announced that the
      troops of the infamous Padella were in flight: then it was said that the
      royal army would soon come up with the enemy, and then&mdash;then the news
      came that King Cavolfiore was vanquished and slain by His Majesty, King
      Padella the First!
    </p>
    <p>
      At this news, half the courtiers ran off to pay their duty to the
      conquering chief, and the other half ran away, laying hands on all the
      best articles in the palace; and poor little Rosalba was left there quite
      alone&mdash;quite alone; and she toddled from one room to another, crying,
      &lsquo;Countess! Duchess!&rsquo; (Only she said &lsquo;Tountess, Duttess,&rsquo; not being able to
      speak plain) &lsquo;bring me my mutton sop; my Royal Highness hungy! Tountess!
      Duttess!&rsquo; And she went from the private apartments into the throne-room
      and nobody was there;&mdash;and thence into the ballroom and nobody was
      there;&mdash;and thence into the pages&rsquo; room and nobody was there;&mdash;and
      she toddled down the great staircase into the hall and nobody was there;&mdash;and
      the door was open, and she went into the court, and into the garden, and
      thence into the wilderness, and thence into the forest where the wild
      beasts live, and was never heard of any more!
    </p>
    <p>
      A piece of her torn mantle and one of her shoes were found in the wood in
      the mouths of two lionesses&rsquo; cubs whom KING PADELLA and a royal hunting
      party shot&mdash;for he was King now, and reigned over Crim Tartary. &lsquo;So
      the poor little Princess is done for,&rsquo; said he; &lsquo;well, what&rsquo;s done can&rsquo;t
      be helped. Gentlemen, let us go to luncheon!&rsquo; And one of the courtiers
      took up the shoe and put it in his pocket. And there was an end of
      Rosalba!

    <h2>
      IV. HOW BLACKSTICK WAS NOT ASKED TO THE PRINCESS ANGELICA&rsquo;S CHRISTENING
    </h2>
    <p>
      When the Princess Angelica was born, her parents not only did not ask the
      Fairy Blackstick to the christening party, but gave orders to their porter
      absolutely to refuse her if she called. This porter&rsquo;s name was Gruffanuff,
      and he had been selected for the post by their Royal Highnesses because he
      was a very tall fierce man, who could say &lsquo;Not at home&rsquo; to a tradesman or
      an unwelcome visitor with a rudeness which frightened most such persons
      away. He was the husband of that Countess whose picture we have just seen,
      and as long as they were together they quarrelled from morning till night.
      Now this fellow tried his rudeness once too often, as you shall hear. For
      the Fairy Blackstick coming to call upon the Prince and Princess, who were
      actually sitting at the open drawing-room window, Gruffanuff not only
      denied them, but made the most ODIOUS VULGAR SIGN as he was going to slam
      the door in the Fairy&rsquo;s face! &lsquo;Git away, hold Blackstick!&rsquo; said he. &lsquo;I
      tell you, Master and Missis ain&rsquo;t at home to you;&rsquo; and he was, as we have
      said, GOING to slam the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the Fairy, with her wand, prevented the door being shut; and
      Gruffanuff came out again in a fury, swearing in the most abominable way,
      and asking the Fairy &lsquo;whether she thought he was a going to stay at that
      there door hall day?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You ARE going to stay at that door all day and all night, and for many a
      long year,&rsquo; the Fairy said, very majestically; and Gruffanuff, coming out
      of the door, straddling before it with his great calves, burst out
      laughing, and cried, &lsquo;Ha, ha, ha! this is a good un! Ha&mdash;ah&mdash;what&rsquo;s
      this? Let me down&mdash;O&mdash;o&mdash;H&rsquo;m!&rsquo; and then he was dumb!
    </p>
    <p>
      For, as the Fairy waved her wand over him, he felt himself rising off the
      ground, and fluttering up against the door, and then, as if a screw ran
      into his stomach, he felt a dreadful pain there, and was pinned to the
      door; and then his arms flew up over his head; and his legs, after
      writhing about wildly, twisted under his body; and he felt cold, cold,
      growing over him, as if he was turning into metal; and he said, &lsquo;O&mdash;o&mdash;H&rsquo;m!&rsquo; 
      and could say no more, because he was dumb.
    </p>
    <p>
      He WAS turned into metal! He was, from being BRAZEN, BRASS! He was neither
      more nor less than a knocker! And there he was, nailed to the door in the
      blazing summer day, till he burned almost red-hot; and there he was,
      nailed to the door all the bitter winter nights, till his brass nose was
      dropping with icicles. And the postman came and rapped at him, and the
      vulgarest boy with a letter came and hit him up against the door. And the
      King and Queen (Princess and Prince they were then) coming home from a
      walk that evening, the King said, &lsquo;Hullo, my dear! you have had a new
      knocker put on the door. Why, it&rsquo;s rather like our porter in the face!
      What has become of that boozy vagabond?&rsquo; And the house-maid came and
      scrubbed his nose with sandpaper; and once, when the Princess Angelica&rsquo;s
      little sister was born, he was tied up in an old kid glove; and, another
      night, some LARKING young men tried to wrench him off, and put him to the
      most excruciating agony with a turn screw. And then the Queen had a fancy
      to have the colour of the door altered; and the painters dabbed him over
      the mouth and eyes, and nearly choked him, as they painted him pea-green.
      I warrant he had leisure to repent of having been rude to the Fairy
      Blackstick!
    </p>
    <p>
      As for his wife, she did not miss him; and as he was always guzzling beer
      at the public-house, and notoriously quarrelling with his wife, and in
      debt to the tradesmen, it was supposed he had run away from all these
      evils, and emigrated to Australia or America. And when the Prince and
      Princess chose to become King and Queen, they left their old house, and
      nobody thought of the porter any more.

    <h2>
      V. HOW PRINCESS ANGELICA TOOK A LITTLE MAID
    </h2>
    <p>
      One day, when the Princess Angelica was quite a little girl, she was
      walking in the garden of the palace, with Mrs. Gruffanuff, the governess,
      holding a parasol over her head, to keep her sweet complexion from the
      freckles, and Angelica was carrying a bun, to feed the swans and ducks in
      the royal pond.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had not reached the duck-pond, when there came toddling up to them
      such a funny little girl! She had a great quantity of hair blowing about
      her chubby little cheeks, and looked as if she had not been washed or
      combed for ever so long. She wore a ragged bit of a cloak, and had only
      one shoe on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You little wretch, who let you in here?&rsquo; asked Mrs. Gruffanuff.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Div me dat bun,&rsquo; said the little girl, &lsquo;me vely hungy.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hungry! what is that?&rsquo; asked Princess Angelica, and gave the child the
      bun.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, Princess!&rsquo; says Mrs. Gruffanuff, &lsquo;how good, how kind, how truly
      angelical you are! See, Your Majesties,&rsquo; she said to the King and Queen,
      who now came up, along with their nephew, Prince Giglio, &lsquo;how kind the
      Princess is! She met this little dirty wretch in the garden&mdash;I can&rsquo;t
      tell how she came in here, or why the guards did not shoot her dead at the
      gate!&mdash;and the dear darling of a Princess has given her the whole of
      her bun!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I didn&rsquo;t want it,&rsquo; said Angelical
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But you are a darling little angel all the same,&rsquo; says the governess.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes; I know I am,&rsquo; said Angelical &lsquo;Dirty little girl, don&rsquo;t you think I
      am very pretty?&rsquo; Indeed, she had on the finest of little dresses and hats;
      and, as her hair was carefully curled, she really looked very well.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, pooty, pooty!&rsquo; says the little girl, capering about, laughing, and
      dancing, and munching her bun; and as she ate it she began to sing, &lsquo;Oh,
      what fun to have a plum bun! how I wis it never was done!&rsquo; At which, and
      her funny accent, Angelica, Giglio, and the King and Queen began to laugh
      very merrily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I can dance as well as sing,&rsquo; says the little girl. &lsquo;I can dance, and I
      can sing, and I can do all sorts of ting.&rsquo; And she ran to a flower-bed,
      and pulling a few polyanthuses, rhododendrons, and other flowers, made
      herself a little wreath, and danced before the King and Queen so drolly
      and prettily, that everybody was delighted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Who was your mother&mdash;who were your relations, little girl?&rsquo; said the
      Queen.
    </p>
    <p>
      The little girl said, &lsquo;Little lion was my brudder; great big lioness my
      mudder; neber heard of any udder.&rsquo; And she capered away on her one shoe,
      and everybody was exceedingly diverted.
    </p>
    <p>
      So Angelica said to the Queen, &lsquo;Mamma, my parrot flew away yesterday out
      of its cage, and I don&rsquo;t care any more for any of my toys; and I think
      this funny little dirty child will amuse me. I will take her home, and
      give her some of my old frocks.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, the generous darling!&rsquo; says Mrs. Gruffanuff.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Which I have worn ever so many times, and am quite tired of,&rsquo; Angelica
      went on; &lsquo;and she shall be my little maid. Will you come home with me,
      little dirty girl?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The child clapped her hands, and said, &lsquo;Go home with you&mdash;yes! You
      pooty Princess!&mdash;Have a nice dinner, and wear a new dress!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      And they all laughed again, and took home the child to the palace, where,
      when she was washed and combed, and had one of the Princess&rsquo;s frocks given
      to her, she looked as handsome as Angelica, almost. Not that Angelica ever
      thought so; for this little lady never imagined that anybody in the world
      could be as pretty, as good, or as clever as herself. In order that the
      little girl should not become too proud and conceited, Mrs. Gruffanuff
      took her old ragged mantle and one shoe, and put them into a glass box,
      with a card laid upon them, upon which was written, &lsquo;These were the old
      clothes in which little BETSINDA was found when the great goodness and
      admirable kindness of Her Royal Highness the Princess Angelica received
      this little outcast.&rsquo; And the date was added, and the box locked up.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a while little Betsinda was a great favourite with the Princess, and
      she danced, and sang, and made her little rhymes, to amuse her mistress.
      But then the Princess got a monkey, and afterwards a little dog, and
      afterwards a doll, and did not care for Betsinda any more, who became very
      melancholy and quiet, and sang no more funny songs, because nobody cared
      to hear her. And then, as she grew older, she was made a little
      lady&rsquo;s-maid to the Princess; and though she had no wages, she worked and
      mended, and put Angelica&rsquo;s hair in papers, and was never cross when
      scolded, and was always eager to please her mistress, and was always up
      early and to bed late, and at hand when wanted, and in fact became a
      perfect little maid. So the two girls grew up, and, when the Princess came
      out, Betsinda was never tired of waiting on her; and made her dresses
      better than the best milliner, and was useful in a hundred ways. Whilst
      the Princess was having her masters, Betsinda would sit and watch them;
      and in this way she picked up a great deal of learn ing; for she was
      always awake, though her mistress was not, and listened to the wise
      professors when Angelica was yawning or thinking of the next ball. And
      when the dancing-master came, Betsinda learned along with Angelica; and
      when the music-master came, she watched him, and practiced the Princess&rsquo;s
      pieces when Angelica was away at balls and parties; and when the
      drawing-master came, she took note of all he said and did; and the same
      with French, Italian, and all other languages&mdash;she learned them from
      the teacher who came to Angelica. When the Princess was going out of an
      evening she would say, &lsquo;My good Betsinda, you may as well finish what I
      have begun.&rsquo; &lsquo;Yes, miss,&rsquo; Betsinda would say, and sit down very cheerful,
      not to FINISH what Angelica began, but to DO it.
    </p>
    <p>
      For instance, the Princess would begin a head of a warrior, let us say,
      and when it was begun it was something like this&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      But when it was done, the warrior was like this&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      (only handsomer still if possible), and the Princess put her name to the
      drawing; and the Court and King and Queen, and above all poor Giglio,
      admired the picture of all things, and said, &lsquo;Was there ever a genius like
      Angelica?&rsquo; So, I am sorry to say, was it with the Princess&rsquo;s embroidery
      and other accomplishments; and Angelica actually believed that she did
      these things herself, and received all the flattery of the Court as if
      every word of it was true. Thus she began to think that there was no young
      woman in all the world equal to herself, and that no young man was good
      enough for her. As for Betsinda, as she heard none of these praises, she
      was not puffed up by them, and being a most grateful, good-natured girl,
      she was only too anxious to do everything which might give her mistress
      pleasure. Now you begin to perceive that Angelica had faults of her own,
      and was by no means such a wonder of wonders as people represented Her
      Royal Highness to be.

    <h2>
      VI. HOW PRINCE GIGLIO BEHAVED HIMSELF
    </h2>
    <p>
      And now let us speak about Prince Giglio, the nephew of the reigning
      monarch of Paflagonia. It has already been stated, in page seven, that as
      long as he had a smart coat to wear, a good horse to ride, and money in
      his pocket, or rather to take out of his pocket, for he was very
      good-natured, my young Prince did not care for the loss of his crown and
      sceptre, being a thoughtless youth, not much inclined to politics or any
      kind of learning. So his tutor had a sinecure. Giglio would not learn
      classics or mathematics, and the Lord Chancellor of Paflagonia,
      SQUARETOSO, pulled a very long face because the Prince could not be got to
      study the Paflagonian laws and constitution; but, on the other hand, the
      King&rsquo;s gamekeepers and huntsmen found the Prince an apt pupil; the
      dancing-master pronounced that he was a most elegant and assiduous
      scholar; the First Lord of the Billiard Table gave the most flattering
      reports of the Prince&rsquo;s skill; so did the Groom of the Tennis Court; and
      as for the Captain of the Guard and Fencing Master, the VALIANT and
      VETERAN Count KUTASOFF HEDZOFF, he avowed that since he ran the General of
      Crim Tartary, the dreadful Grumbuskin, through the body, he never had
      encountered so expert a swordsman as Prince Giglio.
    </p>
    <p>
      I hope you do not imagine that there was any impropriety in the Prince and
      Princess walking together in the palace garden, and because Giglio kissed
      Angelica&rsquo;s hand in a polite manner. In the first place they are cousins;
      next, the Queen is walking in the garden too (you cannot see her, for she
      happens to be behind that tree), and Her Majesty always wished that
      Angelica and Giglio should marry: so did Giglio: so did Angelica
      sometimes, for she thought her cousin very handsome, brave, and
      good-natured: but then you know she was so clever and knew so many things,
      and poor Giglio knew nothing, and had no conversation. When they looked at
      the stars, what did Giglio know of the heavenly bodies? Once, when on a
      sweet night in a balcony where they were standing, Angelica said, &lsquo;There
      is the Bear.&rsquo; &lsquo;Where?&rsquo; says Giglio. &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t be afraid, Angelica! if a dozen
      bears come, I will kill them rather than they shall hurt you.&rsquo; &lsquo;Oh, you
      silly creature!&rsquo; says she; &lsquo;you are very good, but you are not very wise.&rsquo; 
      When they looked at the flowers, Giglio was utterly unacquainted with
      botany, and had never heard of Linnaeus. When the butterflies passed,
      Giglio knew nothing about them, being as ignorant of entomology as I am of
      algebra. So you see, Angelica, though she liked Giglio pretty well,
      despised him on account of his ignorance. I think she probably valued HER
      OWN LEARNING rather too much; but to think too well of one&rsquo;s self is the
      fault of people of all ages and both sexes. Finally, when nobody else was
      there, Angelica liked her cousin well enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      King Valoroso was very delicate in health, and withal so fond of good
      dinners (which were prepared for him by his French cook Marmitonio), that
      it was supposed he could not live long. Now the idea of anything happening
      to the King struck the artful Prime Minister and the designing old
      lady-in-waiting with terror. For, thought Glumboso and the Countess, &lsquo;when
      Prince Giglio marries his cousin and comes to the throne, what a pretty
      position we shall be in, whom he dislikes, and who have always been unkind
      to him. We shall lose our places in a trice; Mrs. Gruffanuff will have to
      give up all the jewels, laces, snuff-boxes, rings, and watches which
      belonged to the Queen, Giglio&rsquo;s mother; and Glumboso will be forced to
      refund two hundred and seventeen thousand millions nine hundred and
      eighty-seven thousand four hundred and thirty-nine pounds, thirteen
      shillings, and sixpence halfpenny, money left to Prince Giglio by his poor
      dear father.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      So the Lady of Honour and the Prime Minister hated Giglio because they had
      done him a wrong; and these unprincipled people invented a hundred cruel
      stories about poor Giglio, in order to influence the King, Queen, and
      Princess against him; how he was so ignorant that he could not spell the
      commonest words, and actually wrote Valoroso Valloroso, and spelt Angelica
      with two l&rsquo;s; how he drank a great deal too much wine at dinner, and was
      always idling in the stables with the grooms; how he owed ever so much
      money at the pastry-cook&rsquo;s and the haberdasher&rsquo;s; how he used to go to
      sleep at church; how he was fond of playing cards with the pages. So did
      the Queen like playing cards; so did the King go to sleep at church, and
      eat and drink too much; and, if Giglio owed a trifle for tarts, who owed
      him two hundred and seventeen thousand millions nine hundred and
      eighty-seven thousand four hundred and thirty-nine pounds, thirteen
      shillings, and sixpence halfpenny, I should like to know? Detractors and
      tale-bearers (in my humble opinion) had much better look at HOME. All this
      backbiting and slandering had effect upon Princess Angelica, who began to
      look coldly on her cousin, then to laugh at him and scorn him for being so
      stupid, then to sneer at him for having vulgar associates; and at Court
      balls, dinners, and so forth, to treat him so unkindly that poor Giglio
      became quite ill, took to his bed, and sent for the doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      His Majesty King Valoroso, as we have seen, had his own reasons for
      disliking his nephew; and as for those innocent readers who ask why?&mdash;I
      beg (with the permission of their dear parents) to refer them to
      Shakespeare&rsquo;s pages, where they will read why King John disliked Prince
      Arthur. With the Queen, his royal but weak-minded aunt, when Giglio was
      out of sight he was out of mind. While she had her whist and her evening
      parties, she cared for little else.
    </p>
    <p>
      I dare say TWO VILLAINS, who shall be nameless, wished Doctor Pildrafto,
      the Court Physician, had killed Giglio right out, but he only bled and
      physicked him so severely that the Prince was kept to his room for several
      months, and grew as thin as a post.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whilst he was lying sick in this way, there came to the Court of
      Paflagonia a famous painter, whose name was Tomaso Lorenzo, and who was
      Painter in Ordinary to the King of Crim Tartary, Paflagonia&rsquo;s neighbour.
      Tomaso Lorenzo painted all the Court, who were delighted with his works;
      for even Countess Gruffanuff looked young and Glumboso good-humoured in
      his pictures. &lsquo;He flatters very much,&rsquo; some people said. &lsquo;Nay!&rsquo; says
      Princess Angelica, &lsquo;I am above flattery, and I think he did not make my
      picture handsome enough. I can&rsquo;t bear to hear a man of genius unjustly
      cried down, and I hope my dear papa will make Lorenzo a knight of his
      Order of the Cucumber.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The Princess Angelica, although the courtiers vowed Her Royal Highness
      could draw so BEAUTIFULLY that the idea of her taking lessons was absurd,
      yet chose to have Lorenzo for a teacher, and it was wonderful, AS LONG AS
      SHE PAINTED IN HIS STUDIO, what beautiful pictures she made! Some of the
      performances were engraved for the Book of Beauty: others were sold for
      enormous sums at Charity Bazaars. She wrote the SIGNATURES under the
      drawings, no doubt, but I think I know who-did the pictures&mdash;this
      artful painter, who had come with other designs on Angelica than merely to
      teach her to draw.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day, Lorenzo showed the Princess a portrait of a young man in armour,
      with fair hair and the loveliest blue eyes, and an expression at once
      melancholy and interesting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Dear Signor Lorenzo, who is this?&rsquo; asked the Princess.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I never saw anyone so handsome,&rsquo; says Countess Gruffanuff (the old
      humbug).
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That,&rsquo; said the painter, &lsquo;that, Madam, is the portrait of my august young
      master, his Royal Highness Bulbo, Crown Prince of Crim Tartary, Duke of
      Acroceraunia, Marquis of Poluphloisboio, and Knight Grand Cross of the
      Order of the Pumpkin. That is the order of the Pumpkin glittering on his
      manly breast, and received by His Royal Highness from his august father,
      His Majesty King PADELLA I., for his gallantry at the battle of
      Rimbombamento, when he slew with his own princely hand the King of Ograria
      and two hundred and eleven giants of the two hundred and eighteen who
      formed the King&rsquo;s bodyguard. The remainder were destroyed by the brave
      Crim Tartar army after an obstinate combat, in which the Crim Tartars
      suffered severely.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      What a Prince! thought Angelica: so brave&mdash;so calm-looking&mdash;so
      young&mdash;what a hero!
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He is as accomplished as he is brave,&rsquo; continued the Court Painter. &lsquo;He
      knows all languages perfectly: sings deliciously: plays every instrument:
      composes operas which have been acted a thousand nights running at the
      Imperial Theatre of Crim Tartary, and danced in a ballet there before the
      King and Queen; in which he looked so beautiful, that his cousin, the
      lovely daughter of the King of Circassia, died for love of him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why did he not marry the poor Princess?&rsquo; asked Angelica, with a sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Because they were FIRST COUSINS, Madam, and the clergy forbid these
      unions,&rsquo; said the Painter. &lsquo;And, besides, the young Prince had given his
      royal heart ELSEWHERE.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And to whom?&rsquo; asked Her Royal Highness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am not at liberty to mention the Princess&rsquo;s name,&rsquo; answered the
      Painter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But you may tell me the first letter of it,&rsquo; gasped out the Princess.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That Your Royal Highness is at liberty to guess,&rsquo; said Lorenzo.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Does it begin with a Z?&rsquo; asked Angelica.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Painter said it wasn&rsquo;t a Z; then she tried a Y; then an X; then a W,
      and went so backwards through almost the whole alphabet.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she came to D, and it wasn&rsquo;t D, she grew very excited; when she came
      to C, and it wasn&rsquo;t C, she was still more nervous; when she came to B, AND
      IT WASN&rsquo;T B, &lsquo;O dearest Gruffanuff,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;lend me your
      smelling-bottle!&rsquo; and, hiding her head in the Countess&rsquo;s shoulder, she
      faintly whispered, &lsquo;Ah, Signor, can it be A?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It was A; and though I may not, by my Royal Master&rsquo;s orders, tell Your
      Royal Highness the Princess&rsquo;s name, whom he fondly, madly, devotedly,
      rapturously loves, I may show you her portrait,&rsquo; says this slyboots: and
      leading the Princess up to a gilt frame, he drew a curtain which was
      before it.
    </p>
    <p>
      O goodness! the frame contained A LOOKING-GLASS! and Angelica saw her own
      face!

    <h2>
      VII. HOW GIGLIO AND ANGELICA HAD A QUARREL
    </h2>
    <p>
      The Court Painter of His Majesty the King of Crim Tartary returned to that
      monarch&rsquo;s dominions, carrying away a number of sketches which he had made
      in the Paflagonian capital (you know, of course, my dears, that the name
      of that capital is Blombodinga); but the most charming of all his pieces
      was a portrait of the Princess Angelica, which all the Crim Tartar nobles
      came to see. With this work the King was so delighted, that he decorated
      the Painter with his Order of the Pumpkin (sixth class) and the artist
      became Sir Tomaso Lorenzo, K.P., thenceforth.
    </p>
    <p>
      King Valoroso also sent Sir Tomaso his Order of the Cucumber, besides a
      handsome order for money, for he painted the King, Queen, and principal
      nobility while at Blombodinga, and became all the fashion, to the perfect
      rage of all the artists in Paflagonia, where the King used to point to the
      portrait of Prince Bulbo, which Sir Tomaso had left behind him, and say
      &lsquo;Which among you can paint a picture like that?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      It hung in the royal parlour over the royal sideboard, and Princess
      Angelica could always look at it as she sat making the tea. Each day it
      seemed to grow handsomer and handsomer, and the Princess grew so fond of
      looking at it, that she would often spill the tea over the cloth, at which
      her father and mother would wink and wag their heads, and say to each
      other, &lsquo;Aha! we see how things are going.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      In the meantime poor Giglio lay upstairs very sick in his chamber, though
      he took all the doctor&rsquo;s horrible medicines like a good young lad; as I
      hope YOU do, my dears, when you are ill and mamma sends for the medical
      man. And the only person who visited Giglio (besides his friend the
      captain of the guard, who was almost always busy or on parade), was little
      Betsinda the housemaid, who used to do his bedroom and sitting-room out,
      bring him his gruel, and warm his bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the little housemaid came to him in the morning and evening, Prince
      Giglio used to say, &lsquo;Betsinda, Betsinda, how is the Princess Angelica?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      And Betsinda used to answer, &lsquo;The Princess is very well, thank you, my
      Lord.&rsquo; And Giglio would heave a sigh, and think, if Angelica were sick, I
      am sure <i>I</i> should not be very well.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Giglio would say, &lsquo;Betsinda, has the Princess Angelica asked for me
      today?&rsquo; And Betsinda would answer, &lsquo;No, my Lord, not today&rsquo;; or, &lsquo;she was
      very busy practicing the piano when I saw her&rsquo;; or, &lsquo;she was writing
      invitations for an evening party, and did not speak to me&rsquo;; or make some
      excuse or other, not strictly consonant with truth: for Betsinda was such
      a good-natured creature that she strove to do everything to prevent
      annoyance to Prince Giglio, and even brought him up roast chicken and
      jellies from the kitchen (when the Doctor allowed them, and Giglio was
      getting better), saying, &lsquo;that the Princess had made the jelly, or the
      bread-sauce, with her own hands, on purpose for Giglio.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      When Giglio heard this he took heart and began to mend immediately; and
      gobbled up all the jelly, and picked the last bone of the chicken&mdash;drumsticks,
      merry-thought, sides&rsquo;-bones, back, pope&rsquo;s nose, and all&mdash;thanking his
      dear Angelica; and he felt so much better the next day, that he dressed
      and went downstairs, where, whom should he meet but Angelica going into
      the drawing-room? All the covers were off the chairs, the chandeliers
      taken out of the bags, the damask curtains uncovered, the work and things
      carried away, and the handsomest albums on the tables. Angelica had her
      hair in papers: in a word, it was evident there was going to be a party.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Heavens, Giglio!&rsquo; cries Angelica: &lsquo;YOU here in such a dress! What a
      figure you are!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, dear Angelica, I am come downstairs, and feel so well today, thanks
      to the FOWL and the JELLY.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What do I know about fowls and jellies, that you allude to them in that
      rude way?&rsquo; says Angelica.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, didn&rsquo;t&mdash;didn&rsquo;t you send them, Angelica dear?&rsquo; says Giglio.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I send them indeed! Angelica dear! No, Giglio dear,&rsquo; says she, mocking
      him, &lsquo;<i>I</i> was engaged in getting the rooms ready for His Royal
      Highness the Prince of Crim Tartary, who is coming to pay my papa&rsquo;s Court
      a visit.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The&mdash;Prince&mdash;of&mdash;Crim&mdash;Tartary!&rsquo; Giglio said, aghast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, the Prince of Crim Tartary,&rsquo; says Angelica, mocking him. &lsquo;I dare say
      you never heard of such a country. What DID you ever hear of? You don&rsquo;t
      know whether Crim Tartary is on the Red Sea or on the Black Sea, I dare
      say.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, I do, it&rsquo;s on the Red Sea,&rsquo; says Giglio, at which the Princess burst
      out laughing at him, and said, &lsquo;Oh, you ninny! You are so ignorant, you
      are really not fit for society! You know nothing but about horses and
      dogs, and are only fit to dine in a mess-room with my Royal father&rsquo;s
      heaviest dragoons. Don&rsquo;t look so surprised at me, sir: go and put your
      best clothes on to receive the Prince, and let me get the drawing-room
      ready.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Giglio said, &lsquo;Oh, Angelica, Angelica, I didn&rsquo;t think this of you. THIS
      wasn&rsquo;t your language to me when you gave me this ring, and I gave you mine
      in the garden, and you gave me that k&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      But what k was we never shall know, for Angelica, in a rage, cried, &lsquo;Get
      out, you saucy, rude creature! How dare you to remind me of your rudeness?
      As for your little trumpery twopenny ring, there, sir, there!&rsquo; And she
      flung it out of the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It was my mother&rsquo;s marriage-ring,&rsquo; cried Giglio.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;<i>I</i> don&rsquo;t care whose marriage-ring it was,&rsquo; cries Angelica. &lsquo;Marry
      the person who picks it up if she&rsquo;s a woman; you shan&rsquo;t marry ME. And give
      me back MY ring. I&rsquo;ve no patience with people who boast about the things
      they give away! <i>I</i> know who&rsquo;ll give me much finer things than you
      ever gave me. A beggarly ring indeed, not worth five shillings!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Now Angelica little knew that the ring which Giglio had given her was a
      fairy ring: if a man wore it, it made all the women in love with him; if a
      woman, all the gentlemen. The Queen, Giglio&rsquo;s mother, quite an
      ordinary-looking person, was admired immensely whilst she wore this ring,
      and her husband was frantic when she was ill. But when she called her
      little Giglio to her, and put the ring on his finger, King Savio did not
      seem to care for his wife so much any more, but transferred all his love
      to little Giglio. So did everybody love him as long as he had the ring;
      but when, as quite a child, he gave it to Angelica, people began to love
      and admire HER; and Giglio, as the saying is, played only second fiddle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; says Angelica, going on in her foolish ungrateful way. &lsquo;<i>I</i>
      know who&rsquo;ll give me much finer things than your beggarly little pearl
      nonsense.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very good, miss! You may take back your ring too!&rsquo; says Giglio, his eyes
      flashing fire at her, and then, as his eyes had been suddenly opened, he
      cried out, &lsquo;Ha! what does this mean? Is THIS the woman I have been in love
      with all my life? Have I been such a ninny as to throw away my regard upon
      you? Why&mdash;actually&mdash;yes&mdash;you are a little crooked!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, you wretch!&rsquo; cries Angelica.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And, upon my conscience, you&mdash;you squint a little.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Eh!&rsquo; cries Angelica.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And your hair is red&mdash;and you are marked with the smallpox&mdash;and
      what? you have three false teeth&mdash;and one leg shorter than the
      other!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You brute, you brute, you!&rsquo; Angelica screamed out: and as she seized the
      ring with one hand, she dealt Giglio one, two, three smacks on the face,
      and would have pulled the hair off his head had he not started laughing,
      and crying&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh dear me, Angelica, don&rsquo;t pull out MY hair, it hurts! You might remove
      a great deal of YOUR OWN, as I perceive, without scissors or pulling at
      all. Oh, ho, ho! ha, ha, ha! ho he he!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      And he nearly choked himself with laughing, and she with rage; when, with
      a low bow, and dressed in his Court habit, Count Gambabella, the first
      lord-in-waiting, entered and said, &lsquo;Royal Highnesses! Their Majesties
      expect you in the Pink Throne-room, where they await the arrival of the
      Prince of CRIM TARTARY.&rsquo;

      VIII. HOW GRUFFANUFF PICKED THE FAIRY RING UP, AND PRINCE BULBO CAME TO
      COURT
    </h2>
    <p>
      Prince Bulbo&rsquo;s arrival had set all the court in a flutter: everybody was
      ordered to put his or her best clothes on: the footmen had their gala
      liveries; the Lord Chancellor his new wig; the Guards their last new
      tunics; and Countess Gruffanuff, you may be sure, was glad of an
      opportunity of decorating HER old person with her finest things. She was
      walking through the court of the Palace on her way to wait upon Their
      Majesties, when she espied something glittering on the pavement, and bade
      the boy in buttons who was holding up her train, to go and pick up the
      article shining yonder. He was an ugly little wretch, in some of the late
      groom-porter&rsquo;s old clothes cut down, and much too tight for him; and yet,
      when he had taken up the ring (as it turned out to be), and was carrying
      it to his mistress, she thought he looked like a little cupid. He gave the
      ring to her; it was a trumpery little thing enough, but too small for any
      of her old knuckles, so she put it into her pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, mum!&rsquo; says the boy, looking at her &lsquo;how&mdash;how beyoutiful you do
      look, mum, today, mum!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And you, too, Jacky,&rsquo; she was going to say; but, looking down at him&mdash;no,
      he was no longer good-looking at all&mdash;but only the carroty-haired
      little Jacky of the morning. However, praise is welcome from the ugliest
      of men or boys, and Gruffanuff, bidding the boy hold up her train, walked
      on in high good-humour. The guards saluted her with peculiar respect.
      Captain Hedzoff, in the anteroom, said, &lsquo;My dear madam, you look like an
      angel today.&rsquo; And so, bowing and smirking, Gruffanuff went in and took her
      place behind her Royal Master and Mistress, who were in the throne-room,
      awaiting the Prince of Crim Tartary. Princess Angelica sat at their feet,
      and behind the King&rsquo;s chair stood Prince Giglio, looking very savage.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Prince of Crim Tartary made his appearance, attended by Baron
      Sleibootz, his chamberlain, and followed by a black page carrying the most
      beautiful crown you ever saw! He was dressed in his travelling costume,
      and his hair, as you see, was a little in disorder. &lsquo;I have ridden three
      hundred miles since breakfast,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;so eager was I to behold the
      Prin&mdash;the Court and august family of Paflagonia, and I could not wait
      one minute before appearing in Your Majesties&rsquo; presences.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Giglio, from behind the throne, burst out into a roar of contemptuous
      laughter; but all the Royal party, in fact, were so flurried, that they
      did not hear this little outbreak. &lsquo;Your R. H. is welcome in any dress,&rsquo; 
      says the King. &lsquo;Glumboso, a chair for His Royal Highness.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Any dress His Royal Highness wears IS a Court dress,&rsquo; says Princess
      Angelica, smiling graciously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah! but you should see my other clothes,&rsquo; said the Prince. &lsquo;I should have
      had them on, but that stupid carrier has not brought them. Who&rsquo;s that
      laughing?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Giglio laughing. &lsquo;I was laughing,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;because you said just
      now that you were in such a hurry to see the Princess, that you could not
      wait to change your dress; and now you say you come in those clothes
      because you have no others.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And who are you?&rsquo; says Prince Bulbo, very fiercely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My father was King of this country, and I am his only son, Prince!&rsquo; 
      replies Giglio, with equal haughtiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ha!&rsquo; said the King and Glumboso, looking very flurried; but the former,
      collecting himself, said, &lsquo;Dear Prince Bulbo, I forgot to introduce to
      Your Royal Highness my dear nephew, His Royal Highness Prince Giglio! Know
      each other! Embrace each other! Giglio, give His Royal Highness your
      hand!&rsquo; and Giglio, giving his hand, squeezed poor Bulbo&rsquo;s until the tears
      ran out of his eyes. Glumboso now brought a chair for the Royal visitor,
      and placed it on the platform on which the King, Queen, and Prince were
      seated; but the chair was on the edge of the platform, and as Bulbo sat
      down, it toppled over, and he with it, rolling over and over, and
      bellowing like a bull. Giglio roared still louder at this disaster, but it
      was with laughter; so did all the Court when Prince Bulbo got up; for
      though when he entered the room he appeared not very ridiculous, as he
      stood up from his fall for a moment he looked so exceedingly plain and
      foolish, that nobody could help laughing at him. When he had entered the
      room, he was observed to carry a rose in his hand, which fell out of it as
      he tumbled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My rose! my rose!&rsquo; cried Bulbo; and his chamberlain dashed forwards and
      picked it up, and gave it to the Prince, who put it in his waistcoat. Then
      people wondered why they had laughed; there was nothing particularly
      ridiculous in him. He was rather short, rather stout, rather red-haired,
      but, in fine, for a Prince, not so bad.
    </p>
    <p>
      So they sat and talked, the Royal personages together, the Crim Tartar
      officers with those of Paflagonia&mdash;Giglio very comfortable with
      Gruffanuff behind the throne. He looked at her with such tender eyes, that
      her heart was all in a flutter. &lsquo;Oh, dear Prince,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;how could
      you speak so haughtily in presence of Their Majesties? I protest I thought
      I should have fainted.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I should have caught you in my arms,&rsquo; said Giglio, looking raptures.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why were you so cruel to Prince Bulbo, dear Prince?&rsquo; says Gruff.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Because I hate him,&rsquo; says Gil.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are jealous of him, and still love poor Angelica,&rsquo; cries Gruffanuff,
      putting her handkerchief to her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I did, but I love her no more!&rsquo; Giglio cried. &lsquo;I despise her! Were she
      heiress to twenty thousand thrones, I would despise her and scorn her. But
      why speak of thrones? I have lost mine. I am too weak to recover it&mdash;I
      am alone, and have no friend.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, say not so, dear Prince!&rsquo; says Gruffanuff.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Besides,&rsquo; says he, &lsquo;I am so happy here BEHIND THE THRONE that I would not
      change my place, no, not for the throne of the world!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What are you two people chattering about there?&rsquo; says the Queen, who was
      rather good-natured, though not overburthened with wisdom. &lsquo;It is time to
      dress for dinner. Giglio, show Prince Bulbo to his room. Prince, if your
      clothes have not come, we shall be very happy to see you as you are.&rsquo; But
      when Prince Bulbo got to his bedroom, his luggage was there and unpacked;
      and the hairdresser coming in, cut and curled him entirely to his own
      satisfaction; and when the dinner-bell rang, the Royal company had not to
      wait above five-and-twenty minutes until Bulbo appeared, during which time
      the King, who could not bear to wait, grew as sulky as possible. As for
      Giglio, he never left Madam Gruffanuff all this time, but stood with her
      in the embrasure of a window, paying her compliments. At length the Groom
      of the Chambers announced His Royal Highness the Prince of Crim Tartary!
      and the noble company went into the royal dining-room. It was quite a
      small party; only the King and Queen, the Princess, whom Bulbo took out,
      the two Princes, Countess Gruffanuff, Glumboso the Prime Minister, and
      Prince Bulbo&rsquo;s chamberlain. You may be sure they had a very good dinner&mdash;let
      every boy or girl think of what he or she likes best, and fancy it on the
      table.*
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     *Here a very pretty game may be played by all the children
     saying what they like best for dinner.
</pre>
    <p>
      The Princess talked incessantly all dinner-time to the Prince of Crimea,
      who ate an immense deal too much, and never took his eyes off his plate,
      except when Giglio, who was carving a goose, sent a quantity of stuffing
      and onion sauce into one of them. Giglio only burst out a-laughing as the
      Crimean Prince wiped his shirt-front and face with his scented
      pocket-handkerchief. He did not make Prince Bulbo any apology. When the
      Prince looked at him, Giglio would not look that way. When Prince Bulbo
      said, &lsquo;Prince Giglio, may I have the honour of taking a glass of wine with
      you?&rsquo; Giglio WOULDN&rsquo;T answer. All his talk and his eyes were for Countess
      Gruffanuff, who you may be sure was pleased with Giglio&rsquo;s attentions&mdash;the
      vain old creature! When he was not complimenting her, he was making fun of
      Prince Bulbo, so loud that Gruffanuff was always tapping him with her fan,
      and saying&mdash;&lsquo;Oh, you satirical Prince! Oh, fie, the Prince will
      hear!&rsquo; &lsquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t mind,&rsquo; says Giglio, louder still. The King and Queen
      luckily did not hear; for Her Majesty was a little deaf, and the King
      thought so much about his own dinner, and, besides, made such a dreadful
      noise, hobgobbling in eating it, that he heard nothing else. After dinner,
      His Majesty and the Queen went to sleep in their arm-chairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was the time when Giglio began his tricks with Prince Bulbo, plying
      that young gentleman with port, sherry, madeira, champagne, marsala,
      cherry-brandy, and pale ale, of all of which Master Bulbo drank without
      stint. But in plying his guest, Giglio was obliged to drink himself, and,
      I am sorry to say, took more than was good for him, so that the young men
      were very noisy, rude, and foolish when they joined the ladies after
      dinner; and dearly did they pay for that imprudence, as now, my darlings,
      you shall hear!
    </p>
    <p>
      Bulbo went and sat by the piano, where Angelica was playing and singing,
      and he sang out of tune, and he upset the coffee when the footman brought
      it, and he laughed out of place, and talked absurdly, and fell asleep and
      snored horridly. Booh, the nasty pig! But as he lay there stretched on the
      pink satin sofa, Angelica still persisted in thinking him the most
      beautiful of human beings. No doubt the magic rose which Bulbo wore caused
      this infatuation on Angelica&rsquo;s part; but is she the first young woman who
      has thought a silly fellow charming?
    </p>
    <p>
      Giglio must go and sit by Gruffanuff, whose old face he, too, every moment
      began to find more lovely. He paid the most outrageous compliments to her:&mdash;There
      never was such a darling&mdash;Older than he was?&mdash;Fiddle-de-dee! He
      would marry her&mdash;he would have nothing but her!
    </p>
    <p>
      To marry the heir to the throne! Here was a chance! The artful hussy
      actually got a sheet of paper, and wrote upon it, &lsquo;This is to give notice
      that I, Giglio, only son of Savio, King of Paflagonia, hereby promise to
      marry the charming and virtuous Barbara Griselda, Countess Gruffanuff, and
      widow of the late Jenkins Gruffanuff, Esq.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What is it you are writing, you charming Gruffy?&rsquo; says Giglio, who was
      lolling on the sofa, by the writing-table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Only an order for you to sign, dear Prince, for giving coals and blankets
      to the poor, this cold weather. Look! the King and Queen are both asleep,
      and your Royal Highness&rsquo;s order will do.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      So Giglio, who was very good-natured, as Gruffy well knew, signed the
      order immediately; and, when she had it in her pocket, you may fancy what
      airs she gave herself. She was ready to flounce out of the room before the
      Queen herself, as now she was the wife of the RIGHTFUL King of Paflagonia!
      She would not speak to Glumboso, whom she thought a brute, for depriving
      her DEAR HUSBAND of the crown! And when candles came, and she had helped
      to undress the Queen and Princess, she went into her own room, and
      actually practiced on a sheet of paper, &lsquo;Griselda Paflagonia,&rsquo; &lsquo;Barbara
      Regina,&rsquo; &lsquo;Griselda Barbara, Paf. Reg.,&rsquo; and I don&rsquo;t know what signatures
      besides, against the day when she should be Queen, forsooth!

      IX. HOW BETSINDA GOT THE WARMING PAN
    </h2>
    <p>
      Little Betsinda came in to put Gruffanuff&rsquo;s hair in papers; and the
      Countess was so pleased, that, for a wonder, she complimented Betsinda.
      &lsquo;Betsinda!&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;you dressed my hair very nicely today; I promised
      you a little present. Here are five sh&mdash;no, here is a pretty little
      ring, that I picked&mdash;that I have had some time.&rsquo; And she gave
      Betsinda the ring she had picked up in the court. It fitted Betsinda
      exactly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s like the ring the Princess used to wear,&rsquo; says the maid.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No such thing,&rsquo; says Gruffanuff, &lsquo;I have had it this ever so long. There,
      tuck me up quite comfortable; and now, as it&rsquo;s a very cold night (the snow
      was beating in at the window), you may go and warm dear Prince Giglio&rsquo;s
      bed, like a good girl, and then you may unrip my green silk, and then you
      can just do me up a little cap for the morning, and then you can mend that
      hole in my silk stocking, and then you can go to bed, Betsinda. Mind I
      shall want my cup of tea at five o&rsquo;clock in the morning.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I suppose I had best warm both the young gentlemen&rsquo;s beds, Ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo; says
      Betsinda.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gruffanuff, for reply, said, &lsquo;Hau-au-ho!&mdash;Grauhawhoo!&mdash;Hong-hrho!&rsquo; 
      In fact, she was snoring sound asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her room, you know, is next to the King and Queen, and the Princess is
      next to them. So pretty Betsinda went away for the coals to the kitchen,
      and filled the royal warming-pan.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, she was a very kind, merry, civil, pretty girl; but there must have
      been something very captivating about her this evening, for all the women
      in the servants&rsquo; hall began to scold and abuse her. The housekeeper said
      she was a pert, stuck-up thing: the upper-housemaid asked, how dare she
      wear such ringlets and ribbons, it was quite improper! The cook (for there
      was a woman-cook as well as a man-cook) said to the kitchen-maid that she
      never could see anything in that creetur: but as for the men, every one of
      them, Coachman, John, Buttons, the page, and Monsieur, the Prince of Crim
      Tartary&rsquo;s valet, started up, and said&mdash; <br /> <br /> &lsquo;My eyes!&rsquo; }<br />
      &lsquo;O mussey!&rsquo; } &lsquo;What a pretty girl Betsinda is!&rsquo;<br /> &lsquo;O jemmany!&rsquo; }<br />
      &lsquo;O ciel!&rsquo; }
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hands off; none of your impertinence, you vulgar, low people!&rsquo; says
      Betsinda, walking off with her pan of coals. She heard the young gentlemen
      playing at billiards as she went upstairs: first to Prince Giglio&rsquo;s bed,
      which she warmed, and then to Prince Bulbo&rsquo;s room.
    </p>
    <p>
      He came in just as she had done; and as soon as he saw her, &lsquo;O! O! O! O!
      O! O! what a beyou&mdash;oo&mdash;ootiful creature you are! You angel&mdash;you
      peri&mdash;you rosebud, let me be thy bulbul&mdash;thy Bulbo, too! Fly to
      the desert, fly with me! I never saw a young gazelle to glad me with its
      dark blue eye that had eyes like shine. Thou nymph of beauty, take, take
      this young heart. A truer never did itself sustain within a soldier&rsquo;s
      waistcoat. Be mine! Be mine! Be Princess of Crim Tartary! My Royal father
      will approve our union; and, as for that little carroty-haired Angelica, I
      do not care a fig for her any more.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Go away, Your Royal Highness, and go to bed, please,&rsquo; said Betsinda, with
      the warming-pan.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Bulbo said, &lsquo;No, never, till thou swearest to be mine, thou lovely,
      blushing chambermaid divine! Here, at thy feet, the Royal Bulbo lies, the
      trembling captive of Betsinda&rsquo;s eyes.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      And he went on, making himself SO ABSURD AND RIDICULOUS, that Betsinda,
      who was full of fun, gave him a touch with the warming-pan, which, I
      promise you, made him cry &lsquo;O-o-o-o!&rsquo; in a very different manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      Prince Bulbo made such a noise that Prince Giglio, who heard him from the
      next room, came in to see what was the matter. As soon as he saw what was
      taking place, Giglio, in a fury, rushed on Bulbo, kicked him in the rudest
      manner up to the ceiling, and went on kicking him till his hair was quite
      out of curl.
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor Betsinda did not know whether to laugh or to cry; the kicking
      certainly must hurt the Prince, but then he looked so droll! When Giglio
      had done knocking him up and down to the ground, and whilst he went into a
      corner rubbing himself, what do you think Giglio does? He goes down on his
      own knees to Betsinda, takes her hand, begs her to accept his heart, and
      offers to marry her that moment. Fancy Betsinda&rsquo;s condition, who had been
      in love with the Prince ever since she first saw him in the palace garden,
      when she was quite a little child.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, divine Betsinda!&rsquo; says the Prince, &lsquo;how have I lived fifteen years in
      thy company without seeing thy perfections? What woman in all Europe,
      Asia, Africa, and America, nay, in Australia, only it is not yet
      discovered, can presume to be thy equal? Angelica? Pish! Gruffanuff? Phoo!
      The Queen? Ha, ha! Thou art my Queen. Thou art the real Angelica, because
      thou art really angelic.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, Prince! I am but a poor chambermaid,&rsquo; says Betsinda, looking,
      however, very much pleased.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Didst thou not tend me in my sickness, when all forsook me?&rsquo; continues
      Giglio. &lsquo;Did not thy gentle hand smooth my pillow, and bring me jelly and
      roast chicken?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, dear Prince, I did,&rsquo; says Betsinda, &lsquo;and I sewed Your Royal
      Highness&rsquo;s shirt-buttons on too, if you please, Your Royal Highness,&rsquo; 
      cries this artless maiden.
    </p>
    <p>
      When poor Prince Bulbo, who was now madly in love with Betsinda, heard
      this declaration, when he saw the unmistakable glances which she flung
      upon Giglio, Bulbo began to cry bitterly, and tore quantities of hair out
      of his head, till it all covered the room like so much tow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Betsinda had left the warming-pan on the floor while the princes were
      going on with their conversation, and as they began now to quarrel and be
      very fierce with one another, she thought proper to run away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You great big blubbering booby, tearing your hair in the corner there; of
      course you will give me satisfaction for insulting Betsinda. YOU dare to
      kneel down at Princess Giglio&rsquo;s knees and kiss her hand!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She&rsquo;s not Princess Giglio!&rsquo; roars out Bulbo. &lsquo;She shall be Princess
      Bulbo, no other shall be Princess Bulbo.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are engaged to my cousin!&rsquo; bellows out Giglio. &lsquo;I hate your cousin,&rsquo; 
      says Bulbo.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You shall give me satisfaction for insulting her!&rsquo; cries Giglio in a
      fury.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll have your life.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll run you through.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll cut your throat.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll blow your brains out.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll knock your head off.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll send a friend to you in the morning.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll send a bullet into you in the afternoon.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We&rsquo;ll meet again,&rsquo; says Giglio, shaking his fist in Bulbo&rsquo;s face; and
      seizing up the warming-pan, he kissed it, because, forsooth, Betsinda had
      carried it, and rushed downstairs. What should he see on the landing but
      His Majesty talking to Betsinda, whom he called by all sorts of fond
      names. His Majesty had heard a row in the building, so he stated, and
      smelling something burning, had come out to see what the matter was.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s the young gentlemen smoking, perhaps, sir,&rsquo; says Betsinda.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Charming chambermaid,&rsquo; says the King (like all the rest of them), &lsquo;never
      mind the young men! Turn thy eyes on a middle-aged autocrat, who has been
      considered not ill-looking in his time.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, sir! what will Her Majesty say?&rsquo; cries Betsinda.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Her Majesty!&rsquo; laughs the monarch. &lsquo;Her Majesty be hanged. Am I not
      Autocrat of Paflagonia? Have I not blocks, ropes, axes, hangmen&mdash;ha?
      Runs not a river by my palace wall? Have I not sacks to sew up wives
      withal? Say but the word, that thou wilt be mine own,&mdash;your mistress
      straightway in a sack is sewn, and thou the sharer of my heart and
      throne.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      When Giglio heard these atrocious sentiments, he forgot the respect
      usually paid to Royalty, lifted up the warming-pan, and knocked down the
      King as flat as a pancake; after which, Master Giglio took to his heels
      and ran away, and Betsinda went off screaming, and the Queen, Gruffanuff,
      and the Princess, all came out of their rooms. Fancy their feelings on
      beholding their husband, father, sovereign, in this posture!

    <h2>
      X. HOW KING VALOROSO WAS IN A DREADFUL PASSION
    </h2>
    <p>
      As soon as the coals began to burn him, the King came to himself and stood
      up. &lsquo;Ho! my captain of the guards!&rsquo; His Majesty exclaimed, stamping his
      royal feet with rage. O piteous spectacle! the King&rsquo;s nose was bent quite
      crooked by the blow of Prince Giglio! His Majesty ground his teeth with
      rage. &lsquo;Hedzoff,&rsquo; he said, taking a death-warrant out of his dressing-gown
      pocket, &lsquo;Hedzoff, good Hedzoff, seize upon the Prince. Thou&rsquo;lt find him in
      his chamber two pair up. But now he dared, with sacrilegious hand, to
      strike the sacred night-cap of a king&mdash;Hedzoff, and floor me with a
      warming-pan! Away, no more demur, the villain dies! See it be done, or
      else,&mdash;h&rsquo;m&mdash;ha!&mdash;h&rsquo;m! mind shine own eyes!&rsquo; and followed by
      the ladies, and lifting up the tails of his dressing-gown, the King
      entered his own apartment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Hedzoff was very much affected, having a sincere love for Giglio.
      &lsquo;Poor, poor Giglio!&rsquo; he said, the tears rolling over his manly face, and
      dripping down his moustachios; &lsquo;my noble young Prince, is it my hand must
      lead thee to death?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Lead him to fiddlestick, Hedzoff,&rsquo; said a female voice. It was
      Gruffanuff, who had come out in her dressing-gown when she heard the
      noise. &lsquo;The King said you were to hang the Prince. Well, hang the Prince.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t understand you,&rsquo; says Hedzoff, who was not a very clever man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You Gaby! he didn&rsquo;t say WHICH Prince,&rsquo; says Gruffanuff.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No; he didn&rsquo;t say which, certainly,&rsquo; said Hedzoff.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well then, take Bulbo, and hang HIM!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      When Captain Hedzoff heard this, he began to dance about for joy.
      &lsquo;Obedience is a soldier&rsquo;s honour,&rsquo; says he. &lsquo;Prince Bulbo&rsquo;s head will do
      capitally,&rsquo; and he went to arrest the Prince the very first thing next
      morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      He knocked at the door. &lsquo;Who&rsquo;s there?&rsquo; says Bulbo. &lsquo;Captain Hedzoff? Step
      in, pray, my good Captain; I&rsquo;m delighted to see you; I have been expecting
      you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Have you?&rsquo; says Hedzoff.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sleibootz, my Chamberlain, will act for me,&rsquo; says the Prince.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I beg Your Royal Highness&rsquo;s pardon, but you will have to act for
      yourself, and it&rsquo;s a pity to wake Baron Sleibootz.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The Prince Bulbo still seemed to take the matter very coolly. &lsquo;Of course,
      Captain,&rsquo; says he, &lsquo;you are come about that affair with Prince Giglio?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Precisely,&rsquo; says Hedzoff, &lsquo;that affair of Prince Giglio.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is it to be pistols, or swords, Captain?&rsquo; asks Bulbo. &lsquo;I&rsquo;m a pretty good
      hand with both, and I&rsquo;ll do for Prince Giglio as sure as my name is My
      Royal Highness Prince Bulbo.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There&rsquo;s some mistake, my Lord,&rsquo; says the Captain. &lsquo;The business is done
      with AXES among us.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Axes? That&rsquo;s sharp work,&rsquo; says Bulbo. &lsquo;Call my Chamberlain, he&rsquo;ll be my
      second, and in ten minutes, I flatter myself, you&rsquo;ll see Master Giglio&rsquo;s
      head off his impertinent shoulders. I&rsquo;m hungry for his blood Hoooo, aw!&rsquo; 
      and he looked as savage as an ogre.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I beg your pardon, sir, but by this warrant I am to take you prisoner,
      and hand you over to&mdash;to the executioner.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Pooh, pooh, my good man!&mdash;Stop, I say,&mdash;ho!&mdash;hulloa!&rsquo; was
      all that this luckless Prince was enabled to say, for Hedzoff&rsquo;s guards
      seizing him, tied a handkerchief over his mouth and face, and carried him
      to the place of execution.
    </p>
    <p>
      The King, who happened to be talking to Glumboso, saw him pass, and took a
      pinch of snuff and said, &lsquo;So much for Giglio. Now let&rsquo;s go to breakfast.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The Captain of the Guard handed over his prisoner to the Sheriff, with the
      fatal order,
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;AT SIGHT CUT OFF THE BEARER&rsquo;S HEAD. &lsquo;VALOROSO XXIV.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s a mistake,&rsquo; says Bulbo, who did not seem to understand the business
      in the least.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Poo&mdash;poo&mdash;pooh,&rsquo; says the Sheriff. &lsquo;Fetch Jack Ketch instantly.
      Jack Ketch!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      And poor Bulbo was led to the scaffold, where an executioner with a block
      and a tremendous axe was always ready in case he should be wanted.
    </p>
    <p>
      But we must now revert to Giglio and Betsinda.

    <h2>
      XI. WHAT GRUFFANUFF DID TO GIGLIO AND BETSINDA
    </h2>
    <p>
      Gruffanuff, who had seen what had happened with the King, and knew that
      Giglio must come to grief, got up very early the next morning, and went to
      devise some plans for rescuing her darling husband, as the silly old thing
      insisted on calling him. She found him walking up and down the garden,
      thinking of a rhyme for Betsinda (TINDER and WINDA were all he could
      find), and indeed having forgotten all about the past evening, except that
      Betsinda was the most lovely of beings.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, dear Giglio,&rsquo; says Gruff.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, dear Gruffy,&rsquo; says Giglio, only HE was quite satirical.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have been thinking, darling, what you must do in this scrape. You must
      fly the country for a while.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What scrape?&mdash;fly the country? Never without her I love, Countess,&rsquo; 
      says Giglio.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, she will accompany you, dear Prince,&rsquo; she says, in her most coaxing
      accents. &lsquo;First, we must get the jewels belonging to our royal parents.
      and those of her and his present Majesty. Here is the key, duck; they are
      all yours, you know, by right, for you are the rightful King of
      Paflagonia, and your wife will be the rightful Queen.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Will she?&rsquo; says Giglio.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes; and having got the jewels, go to Glumboso&rsquo;s apartment, where, under
      his bed, you will find sacks containing money to the amount of
      L2I7,000,000,987,439, 13S. 6 1/2d., all belonging to you, for he took it
      out of your royal father&rsquo;s room on the day of his death. With this we will
      fly.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;WE will fly?&rsquo; says Giglio.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, you and your bride&mdash;your affianced love&mdash;your Gruffy!&rsquo; 
      says the Countess, with a languishing leer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;YOU my bride!&rsquo; says Giglio. &lsquo;You, you hideous old woman!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, you&mdash;you wretch! didn&rsquo;t you give me this paper promising
      marriage?&rsquo; cries Gruff.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Get away, you old goose! I love Betsinda, and Betsinda only!&rsquo; And in a
      fit of terror he ran from her as quickly as he could.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He! he! he!&rsquo; shrieks out Gruff; &lsquo;a promise is a promise if there are laws
      in Paflagonia! And as for that monster, that wretch, that fiend, that ugly
      little vixen&mdash;as for that upstart, that ingrate, that beast,
      Betsinda, Master Giglio will have no little difficulty in discovering her
      whereabouts. He may look very long before finding HER, I warrant. He
      little knows that Miss Betsinda is&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Is&mdash;what? Now, you shall hear. Poor Betsinda got up at five in
      winter&rsquo;s morning to bring her cruel mistress her tea; and instead of
      finding her in a good humour, found Gruffy as cross as two sticks. The
      Countess boxed Betsinda&rsquo;s ears half a dozen times whilst she was dressing;
      but as poor little Betsinda was used to this kind of treatment, she did
      not feel any special alarm. &lsquo;And now,&rsquo; says she, &lsquo;when Her Majesty rings
      her bell twice, I&rsquo;ll trouble you, miss, to attend.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      So when the Queen&rsquo;s bell rang twice, Betsinda came to Her Majesty and made
      a pretty little curtsey. The Queen, the Princess, and Gruffanuff were all
      three in the room. As soon as they saw her they began,
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You wretch!&rsquo; says the Queen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You little vulgar thing!&rsquo; says the Princess.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You beast!&rsquo; says Gruffanuff.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Get out of my sight!&rsquo; says the Queen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Go away with you, do!&rsquo; says the Princess.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Quit the premises!&rsquo; says Gruffanuff.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Alas! and woe is me!&rsquo; very lamentable events had occurred to Betsinda
      that morning, and all in consequence of that fatal warming-pan business of
      the previous night. The King had offered to marry her; of course Her
      Majesty the Queen was jealous: Bulbo had fallen in love with her; of
      course Angelica was furious: Giglio was in love with her, and oh, what a
      fury Gruffy was in! <br /><br /> &lsquo;Take off that {cap } I gave you,&rsquo;<br />
      {petticoat} they said, all<br /> {gown } at once,<br /> and began tearing
      the clothes off poor Betsinda.<br /><br /> &lsquo;How (the King?&rsquo; } cried the
      Queen,<br /> dare you {Prince Bulbo?&rsquo; } the Princess, and<br /> flirt with
      {Prince Giglio?&rsquo; } Countess.<br />
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Give her the rags she wore when she came into the house, and turn her out
      of it!&rsquo; cries the Queen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mind she does not go with MY shoes on, which I lent her so kindly,&rsquo; says
      the Princess; and indeed the Princess&rsquo;s shoes were a great deal too big
      for Betsinda.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come with me, you filthy hussy!&rsquo; and taking up the Queen&rsquo;s poker, the
      cruel Gruffanuff drove Betsinda into her room.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Countess went to the glass box in which she had kept Betsinda&rsquo;s old
      cloak and shoe this ever so long, and said, &lsquo;Take those rags, you little
      beggar creature, and strip off everything belonging to honest people, and
      go about your business&rsquo;; and she actually tore off the poor little
      delicate thing&rsquo;s back almost all her things, and told her to be off out of
      the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor Betsinda huddled the cloak round her back, on which were embroidered
      the letters PRIN. . . ROSAL. . . and then came a great rent.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for the shoe, what was she to do with one poor little tootsey sandal?
      the string was still to it, so she hung it round her neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Won&rsquo;t you give me a pair of shoes to go out in the snow, mum, if you
      please, mum?&rsquo; cried the poor child.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, you wicked beast!&rsquo; says Gruffanuff, driving her along with the poker&mdash;driving
      her down the cold stairs&mdash;driving her through the cold hall&mdash;flinging
      her out into the cold street, so that the knocker itself shed tears to see
      her!
    </p>
    <p>
      But a kind fairy made the soft snow warm for her little feet, and she
      wrapped herself up in the ermine of her mantle, and was gone!
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And now let us think about breakfast,&rsquo; says the greedy Queen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What dress shall I put on, mamma? the pink or the peagreen?&rsquo; says
      Angelica. &lsquo;Which do you think the dear Prince will like best?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mrs. V.!&rsquo; sings out the King from his dressing-room, &lsquo;let us have
      sausages for breakfast! Remember we have Prince Bulbo staying with us!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      And they all went to get ready.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nine o&rsquo;clock came, and they were all in the breakfast-room, and no Prince
      Bulbo as yet. The urn was hissing and humming: the muffins were smoking&mdash;such
      a heap of muffins! the eggs were done, there was a pot of raspberry jam,
      and coffee, and a beautiful chicken and tongue on the side-table.
      Marmitonio the cook brought in the sausages. Oh, how nice they smelt!
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Where is Bulbo?&rsquo; said the King. &lsquo;John, where is His Royal Highness?&rsquo; John
      said he had a took hup His Roilighnessesses shaving-water, and his clothes
      and things, and he wasn&rsquo;t in his room, which he sposed His Royliness was
      just stepped trout.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Stepped out before breakfast in the snow! Impossible!&rsquo; says the King,
      sticking his fork into a sausage. &lsquo;My dear, take one. Angelica, won&rsquo;t you
      have a saveloy?&rsquo; The Princess took one, being very fond of them; and at
      this moment Glumboso entered with Captain Hedzoff, both looking very much
      disturbed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am afraid Your Majesty&mdash;&rsquo; cries Glumboso.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No business before breakfast, Glum!&rsquo; says the King.&rsquo; Breakfast first,
      business next. Mrs. V., some more sugar!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sire, I am afraid if we wait till after breakfast it will be too late,&rsquo; 
      says Glumboso. &lsquo;He&mdash;he&mdash;he&rsquo;ll be hanged at half-past nine.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t talk about hanging and spoil my breakfast, you unkind, vulgar man
      you,&rsquo; cries the Princess. &lsquo;John, some mustard. Pray who is to be hanged?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sire, it is the Prince,&rsquo; whispers Glumboso to the King.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Talk about business after breakfast, I tell you!&rsquo; says His Majesty, quite
      sulky.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We shall have a war, Sire, depend on it,&rsquo; says the Minister. &lsquo;His father,
      King Padella. . .&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;His father, King WHO?&rsquo; says the King. &lsquo;King Padella is not Giglio&rsquo;s
      father. My brother, King Savio, was Giglio&rsquo;s father.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s Prince Bulbo they are hanging, Sire, not Prince Giglio,&rsquo; says the
      Prime Minister.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You told me to hang the Prince, and I took the ugly one,&rsquo; says Hedzoff.
      &lsquo;I didn&rsquo;t, of course, think Your Majesty intended to murder your own flesh
      and blood!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The King for all reply flung the plate of sausages at Hedzoff&rsquo;s head. The
      Princess cried out &lsquo;Hee-kareekaree!&rsquo; and fell down in a fainting fit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Turn the cock of the urn upon Her Royal Highness,&rsquo; said the King, and the
      boiling water gradually revived her. His Majesty looked at his watch,
      compared it by the clock in the parlour, and by that of the church in the
      square opposite; then he wound it up; then he looked at it again. &lsquo;The
      great question is,&rsquo; says he, &lsquo;am I fast or am I slow? If I&rsquo;m slow, we may
      as well go on with breakfast. If I&rsquo;m fast, why, there is just the
      possibility of saving Prince Bulbo. It&rsquo;s a doosid awkward mistake, and
      upon my word, Hedzoff, I have the greatest mind to have you hanged too.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sire, I did but my duty; a soldier has but his orders. I didn&rsquo;t expect
      after forty-seven years of faithful service that my sovereign would think
      of putting me to a felon&rsquo;s death!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A hundred thousand plagues upon you! Can&rsquo;t you see that while you are
      talking my Bulbo is being hung?&rsquo; screamed the Princess.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;By Jove! she&rsquo;s always right, that girl, and I&rsquo;m so absent,&rsquo; says the
      King, looking at his watch again. &lsquo;Ha! there go the drums! What a doosid
      awkward thing though!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, papa, you goose! Write the reprieve, and let me run with it,&rsquo; cries
      the Princess&mdash;and she got a sheet of paper, and pen and ink, and laid
      them before the King.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Confound it! where are my spectacles?&rsquo; the Monarch exclaimed. &lsquo;Angelica!
      go up into my bedroom, look under my pillow, not your mamma&rsquo;s; there
      you&rsquo;ll see my keys. Bring them down to me, and&mdash;Well, well! what
      impetuous things these girls are!&rsquo; Angelica was gone, and had run up
      panting to the bedroom, and found the keys, and was back again before the
      King had finished a muffin. &lsquo;Now, love,&rsquo; says he, &lsquo;you must go all the way
      back for my desk, in which my spectacles are. If you would but have heard
      me out. . . Be hanged to her! There she is off again. Angelica! ANGELICA!&rsquo; 
      When His Majesty called in his LOUD voice, she knew she must obey, and
      came back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My dear, when you go out of a room, how often have I told you, SHUT THE
      DOOR. That&rsquo;s a darling. That&rsquo;s all.&rsquo; At last the keys and the desk and the
      spectacles were got, and the King mended his pen, and signed his name to a
      reprieve, and Angelica ran with it as swift as the wind. &lsquo;You&rsquo;d better
      stay, my love, and finish the muffins. There&rsquo;s no use going. Be sure it&rsquo;s
      too late. Hand me over that raspberry jam, please,&rsquo; said the Monarch.
      &lsquo;Bong! Bawong! There goes the half-hour. I knew it was.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Angelica ran, and ran, and ran, and ran. She ran up Fore Street, and down
      High Street, and through the Market-place, and down to the left, and over
      the bridge, and up the blind alley, and back again, and round by the
      Castle, and so along by the Haberdasher&rsquo;s on the right, opposite the
      lamp-post, and round the square, and she came&mdash;she came to the
      EXECUTION PLACE, where she saw Bulbo laying his head on the block!!! The
      executioner raised his axe, but at that moment the Princess came panting
      up and cried &lsquo;Reprieve!&rsquo; &lsquo;Reprieve!&rsquo; screamed the Princess. &lsquo;Reprieve!&rsquo; 
      shouted all the people. Up the scaffold stairs she sprang, with the
      agility of a lighter of lamps; and flinging herself in Bulbo&rsquo;s arms,
      regardless of all ceremony, she cried out, &lsquo;Oh, my Prince! my lord! my
      love! my Bulbo! Thine Angelica has been in time to save thy precious
      existence, sweet rosebud; to prevent thy being nipped in thy young bloom!
      Had aught befallen thee, Angelica too had died, and welcomed death that
      joined her to her Bulbo.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;H&rsquo;m! there&rsquo;s no accounting for tastes,&rsquo; said Bulbo, looking so very much
      puzzled and uncomfortable that the Princess, in tones of tenderest strain,
      asked the cause of his disquiet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I tell you what it is, Angelica,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;since I came here yesterday,
      there has been such a row, and disturbance, and quarrelling, and fighting,
      and chopping of heads off, and the deuce to pay, that I am inclined to go
      back to Crim Tartary.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But with me as thy bride, my Bulbo! Though wherever thou art is Crim
      Tartary to me, my bold, my beautiful, my Bulbo!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, well, I suppose we must be married,&rsquo; says Bulbo. &lsquo;Doctor, you came
      to read the Funeral Service&mdash;read the Marriage Service, will you?
      What must be, must. That will satisfy Angelica, and then, in the name of
      peace and quietness, do let us go back to breakfast.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Bulbo had carried a rose in his mouth all the time of the dismal ceremony.
      It was a fairy rose, and he was told by his mother that he ought never to
      part with it. So he had kept it between his teeth, even when he laid his
      poor head upon the block, hoping vaguely that some chance would turn up in
      his favour. As he began to speak to Angelica, he forgot about the rose,
      and of course it dropped out of his mouth. The romantic Princess instantly
      stooped and seized it. &lsquo;Sweet rose!&rsquo; she exclaimed, &lsquo;that bloomed upon my
      Bulbo&rsquo;s lip, never, never will I part from thee!&rsquo; and she placed it in her
      bosom. And you know Bulbo COULDN&rsquo;T ask her to give the rose back again.
      And they went to breakfast; and as they walked, it appeared to Bulbo that
      Angelica became more exquisitely lovely every moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was frantic until they were married; and now, strange to say, it was
      Angelica who didn&rsquo;t care about him! He knelt down, he kissed her hand, he
      prayed and begged; he cried with admiration; while she for her part said
      she really thought they might wait; it seemed to her he was not handsome
      any more&mdash;no, not at all, quite the reverse; and not clever, no, very
      stupid; and not well bred, like Giglio; no, on the contrary, dreadfully
      vul&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      What, I cannot say, for King Valoroso roared out &lsquo;POOH, stuff!&rsquo; in a
      terrible voice. &lsquo;We will have no more of this shilly-shallying! Call the
      Archbishop, and let the Prince and Princess be married offhand!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      So, married they were, and I am sure for my part I trust they will be
      happy.

    <h2>
      XII. HOW BETSINDA FLED, AND WHAT BECAME OF HER
    </h2>
    <p>
      Betsinda wandered on and on, till she passed through the town gates, and
      so on the great Crim Tartary road, the very way on which Giglio too was
      going. &lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; thought she, as the diligence passed her, of which the
      conductor was blowing a delightful tune on his horn, &lsquo;how I should like to
      be on that coach!&rsquo; But the coach and the jingling horses were very soon
      gone. She little knew who was in it, though very likely she was thinking
      of him all the time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then came an empty cart, returning from market; and the driver being a
      kind man, and seeing such a very pretty girl trudging along the road with
      bare feet, most good-naturedly gave her a seat. He said he lived on the
      confines of the forest, where his old father was a woodman, and, if she
      liked, he would take her so far on her road. All roads were the same to
      little Betsinda, so she very thankfully took this one.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the carter put a cloth round her bare feet, and gave her some bread
      and cold bacon, and was very kind to her. For all that she was very cold
      and melancholy. When after travelling on and on, evening came, and all the
      black pines were bending with snow, and there, at last, was the
      comfortable light beaming in the woodman&rsquo;s windows; and so they arrived,
      and went into his cottage. He was an old man, and had a number of
      children, who were just at supper, with nice hot bread-and-milk, when
      their elder brother arrived with the cart. And they jumped and clapped
      their hands; for they were good children; and he had brought them toys
      from the town. And when they saw the pretty stranger, they ran to her, and
      brought her to the fire, and rubbed her poor little feet, and brought her
      bread and milk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Look, father!&rsquo; they said to the old woodman, &lsquo;look at this poor girl, and
      see what pretty cold feet she has. They are as white as our milk! And look
      and see what an odd cloak she has, just like the bit of velvet that hangs
      up in our cupboard, and which you found that day the little cubs were
      killed by King Padella, in the forest! And look, why, bless us all! she
      has got round her neck just such another little shoe as that you brought
      home, and have shown us so often&mdash;a little blue velvet shoe!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What,&rsquo; said the old woodman, &lsquo;what is all this about a shoe and a cloak?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      And Betsinda explained that she had been left, when quite a little child,
      at the town with this cloak and this shoe. And the persons who had taken
      care of her had&mdash;had been angry with her, for no fault, she hoped, of
      her own. And they had sent her away with her old clothes&mdash;and here,
      in fact, she was. She remembered having been in a forest&mdash;and perhaps
      it was a dream&mdash;it was so very odd and strange&mdash;having lived in
      a cave with lions there; and, before that, having lived in a very, very
      fine house, as fine as the King&rsquo;s, in the town.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the woodman heard this, he was so astonished, it was quite curious to
      see how astonished he was. He went to his cupboard, and took out of a
      stocking a five-shilling piece of King Cavolfiore, and vowed it was
      exactly like the young woman. And then he produced the shoe and piece of
      velvet which he had kept so long, and compared them with the things which
      Betsinda wore. In Betsinda&rsquo;s little shoe was written, &lsquo;Hopkins, maker to
      the Royal Family&rsquo;; so in the other shoe was written, &lsquo;Hopkins, maker to
      the Royal Family.&rsquo; In the inside of Betsinda&rsquo;s piece of cloak was
      embroidered, &lsquo;PRIN ROSAL&rsquo;; in the other piece of cloak was embroidered
      &lsquo;CESS BA. NO. 246.&rsquo; So that when put together you read, &lsquo;PRINCESS ROSALBA.
      NO. 246.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      On seeing this, the dear old woodman fell down on his knee, saying, &lsquo;O my
      Princess, O my gracious royal lady, O my rightful Queen of Crim Tartary,&mdash;I
      hail thee&mdash;I acknowledge thee&mdash;I do thee homage!&rsquo; And in token
      of his fealty, he rubbed his venerable nose three times on the ground, and
      put the Princess&rsquo;s foot on his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why,&rsquo; said she, &lsquo;my good woodman, you must be a nobleman of my royal
      father&rsquo;s Court!&rsquo; For in her lowly retreat, and under the name of Betsinda,
      HER MAJESTY, ROSALBA, Queen of Crim Tartary, had read of the customs of
      all foreign courts and nations.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Marry, indeed, am I, my gracious liege&mdash;the poor Lord Spinachi once&mdash;the
      humble woodman these fifteen years syne. Ever since the tyrant Padella
      (may ruin overtake the treacherous knave!) dismissed me from my post of
      First Lord.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;First Lord of the Toothpick and Joint Keeper of the Snuffbox? I mind me!
      Thou heldest these posts under our royal Sire. They are restored to thee,
      Lord Spinachi! I make thee knight of the second class of our Order of the
      Pumpkin (the first class being reserved for crowned heads alone). Rise,
      Marquis of Spinachi!&rsquo; And with indescribable majesty, the Queen, who had
      no sword handy, waved the pewter spoon with which she had been taking her
      bread-and-milk, over the bald head of the old nobleman, whose tears
      absolutely made a puddle on the ground, and whose dear children went to
      bed that night Lords and Ladies Bartolomeo, Ubaldo, Catarina, and Ottavia
      degli Spinachi!
    </p>
    <p>
      The acquaintance HER MAJESTY showed with the history, and noble families
      of her empire, was wonderful. &lsquo;The House of Broccoli should remain
      faithful to us,&rsquo; she said; &lsquo;they were ever welcome at our Court. Have the
      Articiocchi, as was their wont, turned to the Rising Sun? The family of
      Sauerkraut must sure be with us&mdash;they were ever welcome in the halls
      of King Cavolfiore.&rsquo; And so she went on enumerating quite a list of the
      nobility and gentry of Crim Tartary, so admirably had Her Majesty profited
      by her studies while in exile.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old Marquis of Spinachi said he could answer for them all; that the
      whole country groaned under Padella&rsquo;s tyranny, and longed to return to its
      rightful sovereign; and late as it was, he sent his children, who knew the
      forest well, to summon this nobleman and that; and when his eldest son,
      who had been rubbing the horse down and giving him his supper, came into
      the house for his own, the Marquis told him to put his boots on, and a
      saddle on the mare, and ride hither and thither to such and such people.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the young man heard who his companion in the cart had been, he too
      knelt down and put her royal foot on his head; he too bedewed the ground
      with his tears; he was frantically in love with her, as everybody now was
      who saw her: so were the young Lords Bartolomeo and Ubaldo, who punched
      each other&rsquo;s little heads out of jealousy; and so, when they came from
      east and west at the summons of the Marquis degli Spinachi, were the Crim
      Tartar Lords who still remained faithful to the House of Cavolfiore. They
      were such very old gentlemen for the most part that Her Majesty never
      suspected their absurd passion, and went among them quite unaware of the
      havoc her beauty was causing, until an old blind Lord who had joined her
      party told her what the truth was; after which, for fear of making the
      people too much in love with her, she always wore a veil. She went about
      privately, from one nobleman&rsquo;s castle to another; and they visited among
      themselves again, and had meetings, and composed proclamations and
      counter-proclamations, and distributed all the best places of the kingdom
      amongst one another, and selected who of the opposition party should be
      executed when the Queen came to her own. And so in about a year they were
      ready to move.
    </p>
    <p>
      The party of Fidelity was in truth composed of very feeble old fogies for
      the most part; they went about the country waving their old swords and
      flags, and calling &lsquo;God save the Queen!&rsquo; and King Padella happening to be
      absent upon an invasion, they had their own way for a little, and to be
      sure the people were very enthusiastic whenever they saw the Queen;
      otherwise the vulgar took matters very quietly, for they said, as far as
      they could recollect, they were pretty well as much taxed in Cavolfiore&rsquo;s
      time, as now in Padella&rsquo;s.

    <h2>
      XIII. HOW QUEEN ROSALBA CAME TO THE CASTLE OF THE BOLD COUNT HOGGINARMO
    </h2>
    <p>
      Her Majesty, having indeed nothing else to give, made all her followers
      Knights of the Pumpkin, and Marquises, Earls, and Baronets; and they had a
      little court for her, and made her a little crown of gilt paper, and a
      robe of cotton velvet; and they quarrelled about the places to be given
      away in her court, and about rank and precedence and dignities;&mdash;you
      can&rsquo;t think how they quarrelled! The poor Queen was very tired of her
      honours before she had had them a month, and I dare say sighed sometimes
      even to be a lady&rsquo;s-maid again. But we must all do our duty in our
      respective stations, so the Queen resigned herself to perform hers.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have said how it happened that none of the Usurper&rsquo;s troops came out to
      oppose this Army of Fidelity: it pottered along as nimbly as the gout of
      the principal commanders allowed: it consisted of twice as many officers
      as soldiers: and at length passed near the estates of one of the most
      powerful noblemen of the country, who had not declared for the Queen, but
      of whom her party had hopes, as he was always quarrelling with King
      Padella.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they came close to his park gates, this nobleman sent to say he would
      wait upon Her Majesty: he was a most powerful warrior, and his name was
      Count Hogginarmo, whose helmet it took two strong negroes to carry. He
      knelt down before her and said, &lsquo;Madam and liege lady! it becomes the
      great nobles of the Crimean realm to show every outward sign of respect to
      the wearer of the Crown, whoever that may be. We testify to our own
      nobility in acknowledging yours. The bold Hogginarmo bends the knee to the
      first of the aristocracy of his country.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Rosalba said, &lsquo;The bold Count of Hogginarmo was uncommonly kind.&rsquo; But she
      felt afraid of him, even while he was kneeling, and his eyes scowled at
      her from between his whiskers, which grew up to them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The first Count of the Empire, madam,&rsquo; he went on, &lsquo;salutes the
      Sovereign. The Prince addresses himself to the not more noble lady! Madam,
      my hand is free, and I offer it, and my heart and my sword to your
      service! My three wives lie buried in my ancestral vaults. The third
      perished but a year since; and this heart pines for a consort! Deign to be
      mine, and I swear to bring to your bridal table the head of King Padella,
      the eyes and nose of his son Prince Bulbo, the right hand and ears of the
      usurping Sovereign of Paflagonia, which country shall thenceforth be an
      appanage to your&mdash;to OUR Crown! Say yes; Hogginarmo is not accustomed
      to be denied. Indeed I cannot contemplate the possibility of a refusal:
      for frightful will be the result; dreadful the murders; furious the
      devastations; horrible the tyranny; tremendous the tortures, misery,
      taxation, which the people of this realm will endure, if Hogginarmo&rsquo;s
      wrath be aroused! I see consent in Your Majesty&rsquo;s lovely eyes&mdash;their
      glances fill my soul with rapture!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, sir!&rsquo; Rosalba said, withdrawing her hand in great fright. &lsquo;Your
      Lordship is exceedingly kind; but I am sorry to tell you that I have a
      prior attachment to a young gentleman by the name of&mdash;Prince Giglio&mdash;and
      never&mdash;never can marry any one but him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Who can describe Hogginarmo&rsquo;s wrath at this remark? Rising up from the
      ground, he ground his teeth so that fire flashed out of his mouth, from
      which at the same time issued remarks and language, so LOUD, VIOLENT, AND
      IMPROPER, that this pen shall never repeat them! &lsquo;R-r-r-r-rr&mdash;Rejected!
      Fiends and perdition! The bold Hogginarmo rejected! All the world shall
      hear of my rage; and you, madam, you above all shall rue it!&rsquo; And kicking
      the two negroes before him, he rushed away, his whiskers streaming in the
      wind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her Majesty&rsquo;s Privy Council was in a dreadful panic when they saw
      Hogginarmo issue from the royal presence in such a towering rage, making
      footballs of the poor negroes&mdash;a panic which the events justified.
      They marched off from Hogginarmo&rsquo;s park very crestfallen; and in another
      half-hour they were met by that rapacious chieftain with a few of his
      followers, who cut, slashed, charged, whacked, banged, and pommelled
      amongst them, took the Queen prisoner, and drove the Army of Fidelity to I
      don&rsquo;t know where.
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor Queen! Hogginarmo, her conqueror, would not condescend to see her.
      &lsquo;Get a horse-van!&rsquo; he said to his grooms, &lsquo;clap the hussy into it, and
      send her, with my compliments, to His Majesty King Padella.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Along with his lovely prisoner, Hogginarmo sent a letter full of servile
      compliments and loathsome flatteries to King Padella, for whose life, and
      that of his royal family, the HYPOCRITICAL HUMBUG pretended to offer the
      most fulsome prayers. And Hogginarmo promised speedily to pay his humble
      homage at his august master&rsquo;s throne, of which he begged leave to be
      counted the most loyal and constant defender. Such a WARY old BIRD as King
      Padella was not to be caught by Master Hogginarmo&rsquo;s CHAFF and we shall
      hear presently how the tyrant treated his upstart vassal. No, no; depend
      on&rsquo;s, two such rogues do not trust one another.
    </p>
    <p>
      So this poor Queen was laid in the straw like Margery Daw, and driven
      along in the dark ever so many miles to the Court, where King Padella had
      now arrived, having vanquished all his enemies, murdered most of them, and
      brought some of the richest into captivity with him for the purpose of
      torturing them and finding out where they had hidden their money.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rosalba heard their shrieks and groans in the dungeon in which she was
      thrust; a most awful black hole, full of bats, rats, mice, toads, frogs,
      mosquitoes, bugs, fleas, serpents, and every kind of horror. No light was
      let into it, otherwise the gaolers might have seen her and fallen in love
      with her, as an owl that lived up in the roof of the tower did, and a cat,
      you know, who can see in the dark, and having set its green eyes on
      Rosalba, never would be got to go back to the turnkey&rsquo;s wife to whom it
      belonged. And the toads in the dungeon came and kissed her feet, and the
      vipers wound round her neck and arms, and never hurt her, so charming was
      this poor Princess in the midst of her misfortunes.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last, after she had been kept in this place EVER SO LONG, the door of
      the dungeon opened, and the terrible KING PADELLA came in.
    </p>
    <p>
      But what he said and did must be reserved for another chapter, as we must
      now back to Prince Giglio.

    <h2>
      XIV. WHAT BECAME OF GIGLIO
    </h2>
    <p>
      The idea of marrying such an old creature as Gruffanuff frightened Prince
      Giglio so, that he ran up to his room, packed his trunks, fetched in a
      couple of porters, and was off to the diligence office in a twinkling.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was well that he was so quick in his operations, did not dawdle over
      his luggage, and took the early coach, for as soon as the mistake about
      Prince Bulbo was found out, that cruel Glumboso sent up a couple of
      policemen to Prince Giglio&rsquo;s room, with orders that he should be carried
      to Newgate, and his head taken off before twelve o&rsquo;clock. But the coach
      was out of the Paflagonian dominions before two o&rsquo;clock; and I dare say
      the express that was sent after Prince Giglio did not ride very quick, for
      many people in Paflagonia had a regard for Giglio, as the son of their old
      sovereign; a Prince who, with all his weaknesses, was very much better
      than his brother, the usurping, lazy, careless, passionate, tyrannical,
      reigning monarch. That Prince busied himself with the balls, fetes,
      masquerades, hunting-parties, and so forth, which he thought proper to
      give on occasion of his daughter&rsquo;s marriage to Prince Bulbo; and let us
      trust was not sorry in his own heart that his brother&rsquo;s son had escaped
      the scaffold.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was very cold weather, and the snow was on the ground, and Giglio, who
      gave his name as simple Mr. Giles, was very glad to get a comfortable
      place in the coupe of the diligence, where he sat with the conductor and
      another gentleman. At the first stage from Blombodinga, as they stopped to
      change horses, there came up to the diligence a very ordinary,
      vulgar-looking woman, with a bag under her arm, who asked for a place. All
      the inside places were taken, and the young woman was informed that if she
      wished to travel, she must go upon the roof; and the passenger inside with
      Giglio (a rude person, I should think), put his head out of the window,
      and said, &lsquo;Nice weather for travelling outside! I wish you a pleasant
      journey, my dear.&rsquo; The poor woman coughed very much, and Giglio pitied
      her. &lsquo;I will give up my place to her,&rsquo; says he, &lsquo;rather than she should
      travel in the cold air with that horrid cough.&rsquo; On which the vulgar
      traveller said, &lsquo;YOU&rsquo;D keep her warm, I am sure, if it&rsquo;s a MUFF she
      wants.&rsquo; On which Giglio pulled his nose, boxed his ears, hit him in the
      eye, and gave this vulgar person a warning never to call him MUFF again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he sprang up gaily on to the roof of the diligence, and made himself
      very comfortable in the straw.
    </p>
    <p>
      The vulgar traveller got down only at the next station, and Giglio took
      his place again, and talked to the person next to him. She appeared to be
      a most agreeable, well-informed, and entertaining female. They travelled
      together till night, and she gave Giglio all sorts of things out of the
      bag which she carried, and which indeed seemed to contain the most
      wonderful collection of articles. He was thirsty&mdash;out there came a
      pint bottle of Bass&rsquo;s pale ale, and a silver mug! Hungry&mdash;she took
      out a cold fowl, some slices of ham, bread, salt, and a most delicious
      piece of cold plum-pudding, and a little glass of brandy afterwards.
    </p>
    <p>
      As they travelled, this plain-looking, queer woman talked to Giglio on a
      variety of subjects, in which the poor Prince showed his ignorance as much
      as she did her capacity. He owned, with many blushes, how ignorant he was;
      on which the lady said, &lsquo;My dear Gigl&mdash;my good Mr. Giles, you are a
      young man, and have plenty of time before you. You have nothing to do but
      to improve yourself. Who knows but that you may find use for your
      knowledge some day? When&mdash;when you may be wanted at home, as some
      people may be.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Good heavens, madam!&rsquo; says he, &lsquo;do you know me?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I know a number of funny things,&rsquo; says the lady. &lsquo;I have been at some
      people&rsquo;s christenings, and turned away from other folks&rsquo; doors. I have
      seen some people spoilt by good fortune, and others, as I hope, improved
      by hardship. I advise you to stay at the town where the coach stops for
      the night. Stay there and study, and remember your old friend to whom you
      were kind.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And who is my old friend?&rsquo; asked Giglio.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;When you want anything,&rsquo; says the lady, &lsquo;look in this bag, which I leave
      to you as a present, and be grateful to&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To whom, madam?&rsquo; says he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To the Fairy Blackstick,&rsquo; says the lady, flying out of the window. And
      then Giglio asked the conductor if he knew where the lady was?
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What lady?&rsquo; says the man; &lsquo;there has been no lady in this coach, except
      the old woman, who got out at the last stage.&rsquo; And Giglio thought he had
      been dreaming. But there was the bag which Blackstick had given him lying
      on his lap; and when he came to the town he took it in his hand and went
      into the inn.
    </p>
    <p>
      They gave him a very bad bedroom, and Giglio, when he woke in the morning,
      fancying himself in the Royal Palace at home, called, &lsquo;John, Charles,
      Thomas! My chocolate&mdash;my dressing-gown&mdash;my slippers&rsquo;; but nobody
      came. There was no bell, so he went and bawled out for water on the top of
      the stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      The landlady came up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What are you a hollering and a bellaring for here, young man?&rsquo; says she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There&rsquo;s no warm water&mdash;no servants; my boots are not even cleaned.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He, he! Clean &lsquo;em yourself,&rsquo; says the landlady. &lsquo;You young students give
      yourselves pretty airs. I never heard such impudence.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll quit the house this instant,&rsquo; says Giglio.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The sooner the better, young man. Pay your bill and be off. All my rooms
      is wanted for gentlefolks, and not for such as you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You may well keep the Bear Inn,&rsquo; said Giglio. &lsquo;You should have yourself
      painted as the sign.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The landlady of the Bear went away GROWLING. And Giglio returned to his
      room, where the first thing he saw was the fairy bag lying on the table,
      which seemed to give a little hop as he came in. &lsquo;I hope it has some
      breakfast in it,&rsquo; says Giglio, &lsquo;for I have only a very little money left.&rsquo; 
      But on opening the bag, what do you think was there? A blacking-brush and
      a pot of Warren&rsquo;s jet, and on the pot was written:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Poor young men their boots must black:
     Use me and cork me and put me back.
</pre>
    <p>
      So Giglio laughed and blacked his boots, and put back the brush and the
      bottle into the bag.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he had done dressing himself, the bag gave another little hop, and he
      went to it and took out&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      1. A tablecloth and a napkin.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. A sugar-basin full of the best loaf-sugar.
    </p>
    <p>
      4, 6, 8, 10. Two forks, two teaspoons, two knives, and a pair of
      sugar-tongs, and a butter-knife all marked G.
    </p>
    <p>
      11, 12, 13. A teacup, saucer, and slop-basin.
    </p>
    <p>
      14. A jug full of delicious cream.
    </p>
    <p>
      15. A canister with black tea and green.
    </p>
    <p>
      16. A large tea-urn and boiling water.
    </p>
    <p>
      17. A saucepan, containing three eggs nicely done.
    </p>
    <p>
      18. A quarter of a pound of best Epping butter.
    </p>
    <p>
      19. A brown loaf.
    </p>
    <p>
      And if he hadn&rsquo;t enough now for a good breakfast, I should like to know
      who ever had one?
    </p>
    <p>
      Giglio, having had his breakfast, popped all the things back into the bag,
      and went out looking for lodgings. I forgot to say that this celebrated
      university town was called Bosforo.
    </p>
    <p>
      He took a modest lodging opposite the Schools, paid his bill at the inn,
      and went to his apartment with his trunk, carpet-bag, and not forgetting,
      we may be sure, his OTHER bag.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he opened his trunk, which the day before he had filled with his best
      clothes, he found it contained only books. And in the first of them which
      he opened there was written&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Clothes for the back, books for the head: Read and remember them when they
      are read.
    </p>
    <p>
      And in his bag, when Giglio looked in it, he found a student&rsquo;s cap and
      gown, a writing-book full of paper, an inkstand, pens, and a Johnson&rsquo;s
      dictionary, which was very useful to him, as his spelling had been sadly
      neglected.
    </p>
    <p>
      So he sat down and worked away, very, very hard for a whole year, during
      which &lsquo;Mr. Giles&rsquo; was quite an example to all the students in the
      University of Bosforo. He never got into any riots or disturbances. The
      Professors all spoke well of him, and the students liked him too; so that,
      when at examination, he took all the prizes, viz. <br /> <br /> {The
      Spelling Prize {The French Prize<br /> {The Writing Prize {The Arithmetic
      Prize<br /> {The History Prize {The Latin Prize<br /> {The Catechism Prize
      {The Good Conduct Prize,
    </p>
    <p>
      all his fellow-students said, &lsquo;Hurrah! Hurray for Giles! Giles is the boy&mdash;the
      student&rsquo;s joy! Hurray for Giles!&rsquo; And he brought quite a quantity of
      medals, crowns, books, and tokens of distinction home to his lodgings.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day after the Examinations, as he was diverting himself at a
      coffee-house with two friends&mdash;(Did I tell you that in his bag, every
      Saturday night, he found just enough to pay his bills, with a guinea over,
      for pocket-money? Didn&rsquo;t I tell you? Well, he did, as sure as twice twenty
      makes forty-five)&mdash;he chanced to look in the Bosforo Chronicle, and
      read off, quite easily (for he could spell, read, and write the longest
      words now), the following:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;ROMANTIC CIRCUMSTANCE.&mdash;One of the most extraordinary adventures
      that we have ever heard has set the neighbouring country of Crim Tartary
      in a state of great excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It will be remembered that when the present revered sovereign of Crim
      Tartary, His Majesty King PADELLA, took possession of the throne, after
      having vanquished, in the terrific battle of Blunderbusco, the late King
      CAVOLFIORE, that Prince&rsquo;s only child, the Princess Rosalba, was not found
      in the royal palace, of which King Padella took possession, and, it was
      said, had strayed into the forest (being abandoned by all her attendants)
      where she had been eaten up by those ferocious lions, the last pair of
      which were captured some time since, and brought to the Tower, after
      killing several hundred persons.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;His Majesty King Padella, who has the kindest heart in the world, was
      grieved at the accident which had occurred to the harmless little
      Princess, for whom His Majesty&rsquo;s known benevolence would certainly have
      provided a fitting establishment. But her death seemed to be certain. The
      mangled remains of a cloak, and a little shoe, were found in the forest,
      during a hunting-party, in which the intrepid sovereign of Crim Tartary
      slew two of the lions&rsquo; cubs with his own spear. And these interesting
      relics of an innocent little creature were carried home and kept by their
      finder, the Baron Spinachi, formerly an officer in Cavolfiore&rsquo;s household.
      The Baron was disgraced in consequence of his known legitimist opinions,
      and has lived for some time in the humble capacity of a wood-cutter, in a
      forest on the outskirts of the Kingdom of Crim Tartary.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Last Tuesday week Baron Spinachi and a number of gentlemen, attached to
      the former dynasty, appeared in arms, crying, &ldquo;God save Rosalba, the first
      Queen of Crim Tartary!&rdquo; and surrounding a lady whom report describes as
      &ldquo;BEAUTIFUL EXCEEDINGLY.&rdquo; Her history MAY be authentic, is certainly most
      romantic.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The personage calling herself Rosalba states that she was brought out of
      the forest, fifteen years since, by a lady in a car drawn by dragons (this
      account is certainly IMPROBABLE), that she was left in the Palace Garden
      of Blombodinga, where Her Royal Highness the Princess Angelica, now
      married to His Royal Highness Bulbo, Crown Prince of Crim Tartary, found
      the child, and, with THAT ELEGANT BENEVOLENCE which has always
      distinguished the heiress of the throne of Paflagonia, gave the little
      outcast a SHELTER AND A HOME! Her parentage not being known, and her garb
      very humble, the foundling was educated in the Palace in a menial
      capacity, under the name of BETSINDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She did not give satisfaction, and was dismissed, carrying with her,
      certainly, part of a mantle and a shoe, which she had on when first found.
      According to her statement she quitted Blombodinga about a year ago, since
      which time she has been with the Spinachi family. On the very same morning
      the Prince Giglio, nephew to the King of Paflagonia, a young Prince whose
      character for TALENT and ORDER were, to say truth, none of the HIGHEST,
      also quitted Blombodinga, and has not been since heard of!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What an extraordinary story!&rsquo; said Smith and Jones, two young students,
      Giglio&rsquo;s especial friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ha! what is this?&rsquo; Giglio went on, reading&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;SECOND EDITION, EXPRESS.&mdash;We hear that the troop under Baron
      Spinachi has been surrounded, and utterly routed, by General Count
      Hogginarmo, and the soidisant Princess is sent a prisoner to the capital.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;UNIVERSITY NEWS.&mdash;Yesterday, at the Schools, the distinguished young
      student, Mr. Giles, read a Latin oration, and was complimented by the
      Chancellor of Bosforo, Dr. Prugnaro, with the highest University honour&mdash;the
      wooden spoon.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Never mind that stuff,&rsquo; says GILES, greatly disturbed. &lsquo;Come home with
      me, my friends. Gallant Smith! intrepid Jones! friends of my studies&mdash;partakers
      of my academic toils&mdash;I have that to tell which shall astonish your
      honest minds.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Go it, old boy!&rsquo; cries the impetuous Smith.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Talk away, my buck!&rsquo; says Jones, a lively fellow.
    </p>
    <p>
      With an air of indescribable dignity, Giglio checked their natural, but no
      more seemly, familiarity. &lsquo;Jones, Smith, my good friends,&rsquo; said the
      PRINCE, &lsquo;disguise is henceforth useless; I am no more the humble student
      Giles, I am the descendant of a royal line.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Atavis edite regibus, I know, old co&mdash;&rsquo; cried Jones. He was going to
      say old cock, but a flash from THE ROYAL EYE again awed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Friends,&rsquo; continued the Prince, &lsquo;I am that Giglio, I am, in fact,
      Paflagonia. Rise, Smith, and kneel not in the public street. Jones, thou
      true heart! My faithless uncle, when I was a baby, filched from me that
      brave crown my father left me, bred me, all young and careless of my
      rights, like unto hapless Hamlet, Prince of Denmark; and had I any
      thoughts about my wrongs, soothed me with promises of near redress. I
      should espouse his daughter, young Angelica; we two indeed should reign in
      Paflagonia. His words were false&mdash;false as Angelica&rsquo;s heart!&mdash;false
      as Angelica&rsquo;s hair, colour, front teeth! She looked with her skew eyes
      upon young Bulbo, Crim Tartary&rsquo;s stupid heir, and she preferred him.&rsquo; Twas
      then I turned my eyes upon Betsinda&mdash;Rosalba, as she now is. And I
      saw in her the blushing sum of all perfection; the pink of maiden modesty;
      the nymph that my fond heart had ever woo&rsquo;d in dreams,&rsquo; etc. etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      (I don&rsquo;t give this speech, which was very fine, but very long; and though
      Smith and Jones knew nothing about the circumstances, my dear reader does,
      so I go on.)
    </p>
    <p>
      The Prince and his young friends hastened home to his apartment, highly
      excited by the intelligence, as no doubt by the ROYAL NARRATOR&rsquo;S admirable
      manner of recounting it, and they ran up to his room where he had worked
      so hard at his books.
    </p>
    <p>
      On his writing-table was his bag, grown so long that the Prince could not
      help remarking it. He went to it, opened it, and what do you think he
      found in it?
    </p>
    <p>
      A splendid long, gold-handled, red-velvet-scabbarded, cut-and-thrust
      sword, and on the sheath was embroidered &lsquo;ROSALBA FOR EVER!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He drew out the sword, which flashed and illuminated the whole room, and
      called out &lsquo;Rosalba for ever!&rsquo; Smith and Jones following him, but quite
      respectfully this time, and taking the time from His Royal Highness.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now his trunk opened with a sudden pony, and out there came three
      ostrich feathers in a gold crown, surrounding a beautiful shining steel
      helmet, a cuirass, a pair of spurs, finally a complete suit of armour.
    </p>
    <p>
      The books on Giglio&rsquo;s shelves were all gone. Where there had been some
      great dictionaries, Giglio&rsquo;s friends found two pairs of jack-boots
      labelled, &lsquo;Lieutenant Smith,&rsquo; &lsquo;&mdash;Jones, Esq.,&rsquo; which fitted them to a
      nicety. Besides, there were helmets, back and breast plates, swords, etc.,
      just like in Mr. G. P. R. James&rsquo;s novels; and that evening three cavaliers
      might have been seen issuing from the gates of Bosforo, in whom the
      porters, proctors, etc., never thought of recognising the young Prince and
      his friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      They got horses at a livery stable-keeper&rsquo;s, and never drew bridle until
      they reached the last town on the frontier before you come to Crim
      Tartary. Here, as their animals were tired, and the cavaliers hungry, they
      stopped and refreshed at an hostel. I could make a chapter of this if I
      were like some writers, but I like to cram my measure tight down, you see,
      and give you a great deal for your money, and, in a word, they had some
      bread and cheese and ale upstairs on the balcony of the inn. As they were
      drinking, drums and trumpets sounded nearer and nearer, the marketplace
      was filled with soldiers, and His Royal Highness looking forth, recognised
      the Paflagonian banners, and the Paflagonian national air which the bands
      were playing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The troops all made for the tavern at once, and as they came up Giglio
      exclaimed, on beholding their leader, &lsquo;Whom do I see? Yes! No! It is, it
      is! Phoo! No, it can&rsquo;t be! Yes! It is my friend, my gallant faithful
      veteran, Captain Hedzoff! Ho! Hedzoff! Knowest thou not thy Prince, thy
      Giglio? Good Corporal, methinks we once were friends. Ha, Sergeant, an&rsquo; my
      memory serves me right, we have had many a bout at singlestick.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo; faith, we have, a many, good my Lord,&rsquo; says the Sergeant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Tell me, what means this mighty armament,&rsquo; continued His Royal Highness
      from the balcony, &lsquo;and whither march my Paflagonians?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Hedzoff&rsquo;s head fell. &lsquo;My Lord,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;we march as the allies of great
      Padella, Crim Tartary&rsquo;s monarch.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Crim Tartary&rsquo;s usurper, gallant Hedzoff! Crim Tartary&rsquo;s grim tyrant,
      honest Hedzoff!&rsquo; said the Prince, on the balcony, quite sarcastically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A soldier, Prince, must needs obey his orders: mine are to help His
      Majesty Padella. And also (though alack that I should say it!) to seize
      wherever I should light upon him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;First catch your hare! ha, Hedzoff!&rsquo; exclaimed His Royal Highness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&mdash;On the body of GIGLIO, whilome Prince of Paflagonia&rsquo; Hedzoff went
      on, with indescribable emotion. &lsquo;My Prince, give up your sword without
      ado. Look! we are thirty thousand men to one!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Give up my sword! Giglio give up his sword!&rsquo; cried the Prince; and
      stepping well forward on to the balcony, the royal youth, WITHOUT
      PREPARATION, delivered a speech so magnificent, that no report can do
      justice to it. It was all in blank verse (in which, from this time, he
      invariably spoke, as more becoming his majestic station). It lasted for
      three days and three nights, during which not a single person who heard
      him was tired, or remarked the difference between daylight and dark. The
      soldiers only cheering tremendously, when occasionally, once in nine
      hours, the Prince paused to suck an orange, which Jones took out of the
      bag. He explained, in terms which we say we shall not attempt to convey,
      the whole history of the previous transaction, and his determination not
      only not to give up his sword, but to assume his rightful crown; and at
      the end of this extraordinary, this truly GIGANTIC effort, Captain Hedzoff
      flung up his helmet, and cried, &lsquo;Hurray! Hurray! Long live King Giglio!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Such were the consequences of having employed his time well at College!
    </p>
    <p>
      When the excitement had ceased, beer was ordered out for the army, and
      their Sovereign himself did not disdain a little! And now it was with some
      alarm that Captain Hedzoff told him his division was only the advanced
      guard of the Paflagonian contingent, hastening to King Padella&rsquo;s aid; the
      main force being a day&rsquo;s march in the rear under His Royal Highness Prince
      Bulbo.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We will wait here, good friend, to beat the Prince,&rsquo; His Majesty said,
      &lsquo;and THEN will make his royal father wince.&rsquo;

      XV. WE RETURN TO ROSALBA
    </h2>
    <p>
      King Padella made very similar proposals to Rosalba to those which she had
      received from the various princes who, as we have seen, had fallen in love
      with her. His Majesty was a widower, and offered to marry his fair captive
      that instant, but she declined his invitation in her usual polite gentle
      manner, stating that Prince Giglio was her love, and that any other union
      was out of the question. Having tried tears and supplications in vain,
      this violent-tempered monarch menaced her with threats and tortures; but
      she declared she would rather suffer all these than accept the hand of her
      father&rsquo;s murderer, who left her finally, uttering the most awful
      imprecations, and bidding her prepare for death on the following morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      All night long the King spent in advising how he should get rid of this
      obdurate young creature. Cutting off her head was much too easy a death
      for her; hanging was so common in His Majesty&rsquo;s dominions that it no
      longer afforded him any sport; finally, he bethought himself of a pair of
      fierce lions which had lately been sent to him as presents, and he
      determined, with these ferocious brutes, to hunt poor Rosalba down.
      Adjoining his castle was an amphitheatre where the Prince indulged in
      bull-baiting, rat-hunting, and other ferocious sports. The two lions were
      kept in a cage under this place; their roaring might be heard over the
      whole city, the inhabitants of which, I am sorry to say, thronged in
      numbers to see a poor young lady gobbled up by two wild beasts.
    </p>
    <p>
      The King took his place in the royal box, having the officers of his Court
      around and the Count Hogginarmo by his side, upon whom His Majesty was
      observed to look very fiercely; the fact is, royal spies had told the
      monarch of Hogginarmo&rsquo;s behaviour, his proposals to Rosalba, and his offer
      to fight for the crown. Black as thunder looked King Padella at this proud
      noble, as they sat in the front seats of the theatre waiting to see the
      tragedy whereof poor Rosalba was to be the heroine.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length that Princess was brought out in her nightgown, with all her
      beautiful hair falling down her back, and looking so pretty that even the
      beef-eaters and keepers of the wild animals wept plentifully at seeing
      her. And she walked with her poor little feet (only luckily the arena was
      covered with sawdust), and went and leaned up against a great stone in the
      centre of the amphitheatre, round which the Court and the people were
      seated in boxes, with bars before them, for fear of the great, fierce,
      red-maned, black-throated, long-tailed, roaring, bellowing, rushing lions.
      And now the gates were opened, and with a wurrawarrurawarar two great
      lean, hungry, roaring lions rushed out of their den, where they had been
      kept for three weeks on nothing but a little toast-and-water, and dashed
      straight up to the stone where poor Rosalba was waiting. Commend her to
      your patron saints, all you kind people, for she is in a dreadful state!
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a hum and a buzz all through the circus, and the fierce King
      Padella even felt a little compassion. But Count Hogginarmo, seated by His
      Majesty, roared out &lsquo;Hurray! Now for it! Soo-soo-soo!&rsquo; that nobleman being
      uncommonly angry still at Rosalba&rsquo;s refusal of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      But O strange event! O remarkable circumstance! O extraordinary
      coincidence, which I am sure none of you could BY ANY POSSIBILITY have
      divined! When the lions came to Rosalba, instead of devouring her with
      their great teeth, it was with kisses they gobbled her up! They licked her
      pretty feet, they nuzzled their noses in her lap, they moo&rsquo;d, they seemed
      to say, &lsquo;Dear, dear sister don&rsquo;t you recollect your brothers in the
      forest?&rsquo; And she put her pretty white arms round their tawny necks, and
      kissed them.
    </p>
    <p>
      King Padella was immensely astonished. The Count Hogginarmo was extremely
      disgusted. &lsquo;Pooh!&rsquo; the Count cried. &lsquo;Gammon!&rsquo; exclaimed his Lordship.&rsquo; 
      These lions are tame beasts come from Wombwell&rsquo;s or Astley&rsquo;s. It is a
      shame to put people off in this way. I believe they are little boys
      dressed up in door-mats. They are no lions at all.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ha!&rsquo; said the King, &lsquo;you dare to say &ldquo;gammon&rdquo; to your Sovereign, do you?
      These lions are no lions at all, aren&rsquo;t they? Ho! my beef-eaters! Ho! my
      bodyguard! Take this Count Hogginarmo and fling him into the circus! Give
      him a sword and buckler, let him keep his armour on, and his weather-eye
      out, and fight these lions.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The haughty Hogginarmo laid down his opera-glass, and looked scowling
      round at the King and his attendants. &lsquo;Touch me not, dogs!&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;or
      by St. Nicholas the Elder, I will gore you! Your Majesty thinks Hogginarmo
      is afraid? No, not of a hundred thousand lions! Follow me down into the
      circus, King Padella, and match thyself against one of yon brutes. Thou
      darest not. Let them both come on, then!&rsquo; And opening a grating of the
      box, he jumped lightly down into the circus.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
              WURRA WURRA WURRA WUR-AW-AW-AW!!!
                  In about two minutes
                The Count Hogginarmo was
                     GOBBLED UP
                         by
                     those lions,
                 bones, boots, and all,
                        and
                    There was an
                     End of him.
</pre>
    <p>
      At this, the King said, &lsquo;Serve him right, the rebellious ruffian! And now,
      as those lions won&rsquo;t eat that young woman&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Let her off!&mdash;let her off!&rsquo; cried the crowd.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;NO!&rsquo; roared the King. &lsquo;Let the beef-eaters go down and chop her into
      small pieces. If the lions defend her, let the archers shoot them to
      death. That hussy shall die in tortures!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A-a-ah!&rsquo; cried the crowd. &lsquo;Shame! shame!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Who dares cry out shame?&rsquo; cried the furious potentate (so little can
      tyrants command their passions). &lsquo;Fling any scoundrel who says a word down
      among the lions!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I warrant you there was a dead silence then, which was broken by a Pang
      arang pang pangkarangpang, and a Knight and a Herald rode in at the
      further end of the circus: the Knight, in full armour, with his vizor up,
      and bearing a letter on the point of his lance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ha!&rsquo; exclaimed the King, &lsquo;by my fey, &lsquo;tis Elephant and Castle, pursuivant
      of my brother of Paflagonia; and the Knight, an&rsquo; my memory serves me, is
      the gallant Captain Hedzoff! What news from Paflagonia, gallant Hedzoff?
      Elephant and Castle, beshrew me, thy trumpeting must have made thee
      thirsty. What will my trusty herald like to drink?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Bespeaking first safe conduct from your Lordship,&rsquo; said Captain Hedzoff,
      &lsquo;before we take a drink of anything, permit us to deliver our King&rsquo;s
      message.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My Lordship, ha!&rsquo; said Crim Tartary, frowning terrifically. &lsquo;That title
      soundeth strange in the anointed ears of a crowned King. Straightway speak
      out your message, Knight and Herald!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Reining up his charger in a most elegant manner close under the King&rsquo;s
      balcony, Hedzoff turned to the Herald, and bade him begin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Elephant and Castle, dropping his trumpet over his shoulder, took a large
      sheet of paper out of his hat, and began to read:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;O Yes! O Yes! O Yes! Know all men by these presents, that we, Giglio,
      King of Paflagonia, Grand Duke of Cappadocia, Sovereign Prince of Turkey
      and the Sausage Islands, having assumed our rightful throne and title,
      long time falsely borne by our usurping Uncle, styling himself King of
      Paflagonia&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ha!&rsquo; growled Padella.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hereby summon the false traitor, Padella, calling himself King of Crim
      Tartary&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The King&rsquo;s curses were dreadful. &lsquo;Go on, Elephant and Castle!&rsquo; said the
      intrepid Hedzoff.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&mdash;To release from cowardly imprisonment his liege lady and rightful
      Sovereign, ROSALBA, Queen of Crim Tartary, and restore her to her royal
      throne: in default of which, I, Giglio, proclaim the said Padella sneak,
      traitor, humbug, usurper, and coward. I challenge him to meet me, with
      fists or with pistols, with battle-axe or sword, with blunderbuss or
      singlestick, alone or at the head of his army, on foot or on horseback;
      and will prove my words upon his wicked ugly body!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;God save the King!&rsquo; said Captain Hedzoff, executing a demivolte, two
      semilunes, and three caracols.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is that all?&rsquo; said Padella, with the terrific calm of concentrated fury.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That, sir, is all my royal master&rsquo;s message. Here is His Majesty&rsquo;s letter
      in autograph, and here is his glove, and if any gentleman of Crim Tartary
      chooses to find fault with His Majesty&rsquo;s expressions, I, Tuffskin Hedzoff,
      Captain of the Guard, am very much at his service,&rsquo; and he waved his
      lance, and looked at the assembly all round.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And what says my good brother of Paflagonia, my dear son&rsquo;s father-in-law,
      to this rubbish?&rsquo; asked the King.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The King&rsquo;s uncle hath been deprived of the crown he unjustly wore,&rsquo; said
      Hedzoff gravely. &lsquo;He and his axminister, Glumboso, are now in prison
      waiting the sentence of my royal master. After the battle of Bombardaro&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Of what?&rsquo; asked the surprised Padella.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Of Bombardaro, where my liege, his present Majesty, would have performed
      prodigies of velour, but that the whole of his uncle&rsquo;s army came over to
      our side, with the exception of Prince Bulbo.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah! my boy, my boy, my Bulbo was no traitor!&rsquo; cried Padella.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Prince Bulbo, far from coming over to us, ran away, sir; but I caught
      him. The Prince is a prisoner in our army, and the most terrific tortures
      await him if a hair of the Princess Rosalba&rsquo;s head is injured.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do they?&rsquo; exclaimed the furious Padella, who was now perfectly LIVID with
      rage.&rsquo; Do they indeed? So much the worse for Bulbo. I&rsquo;ve twenty sons as
      lovely each as Bulbo. Not one but is as fit to reign as Bulbo. Whip,
      whack, flog, starve, rack, punish, torture Bulbo&mdash;break all his bones&mdash;roast
      him or flay him alive&mdash;pull all his pretty teeth out one by one! But
      justly dear as Bulbo is to me,&mdash;joy of my eyes, fond treasure of my
      soul!&mdash;Ha, ha, ha, ha! revenge is dearer still. Ho! tortures,
      rack-men, executioners&mdash;light up the fires and make the pincers hot!
      get lots of boiling lead!&mdash;Bring out ROSALBA!&rsquo;

    <h2>
      XVI. HOW HEDZOFF RODE BACK AGAIN TO KING GIGLIO
    </h2>
    <p>
      Captain Hedzoff rode away when King Padella uttered this cruel command,
      having done his duty in delivering the message with which his royal master
      had entrusted him. Of course he was very sorry for Rosalba, but what could
      he do?
    </p>
    <p>
      So he returned to King Giglio&rsquo;s camp, and found the young monarch in a
      disturbed state of mind, smoking cigars in the royal tent. His Majesty&rsquo;s
      agitation was not appeased by the news that was brought by his ambassador.
      &lsquo;The brutal ruthless ruffian royal wretch!&rsquo; Giglio exclaimed. &lsquo;As
      England&rsquo;s poesy has well remarked, &ldquo;The man that lays his hand upon a
      woman, save in the way of kindness, is a villain.&rdquo; Ha, Hedzoff!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That he is, your Majesty,&rsquo; said the attendant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And didst thou see her flung into the oil? and didn&rsquo;t the soothing oil&mdash;the
      emollient oil, refuse to boil, good Hedzoff&mdash;and to spoil the fairest
      lady ever eyes did look on?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Faith, good my liege, I had no heart to look and see a beauteous lady
      boiling down; I took your royal message to Padella, and bore his back to
      you. I told him you would hold Prince Bulbo answerable. He only said that
      he had twenty sons as good as Bulbo, and forthwith he bade the ruthless
      executioners proceed.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;O cruel father&mdash;O unhappy son!&rsquo; cried the King. &lsquo;Go, some of you,
      and bring Prince Bulbo hither.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Bulbo was brought in chains, looking very uncomfortable. Though a
      prisoner, he had been tolerably happy, perhaps because his mind was at
      rest, and all the fighting was over, and he was playing at marbles with
      his guards when the King sent for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, my poor Bulbo,&rsquo; said His Majesty, with looks of infinite compassion,
      &lsquo;hast thou heard the news?&rsquo; (for you see Giglio wanted to break the thing
      gently to the Prince), &lsquo;thy brutal father has condemned Rosalba&mdash;p-p-p-ut
      her to death, P-p-p-prince Bulbo!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What, killed Betsinda! Boo-hoo-hoo,&rsquo; cried out Bulbo. &lsquo;Betsinda! pretty
      Betsinda! dear Betsinda! She was the dearest little girl in the world. I
      love her better twenty thousand times even than Angelica,&rsquo; and he went on
      expressing his grief in so hearty and unaffected a manner that the King
      was quite touched by it, and said, shaking Bulbo&rsquo;s hand, that he wished he
      had known Bulbo sooner.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bulbo, quite unconsciously, and meaning for the best, offered to come and
      sit with His Majesty, and smoke a cigar with him, and console him. The
      ROYAL KINDNESS supplied Bulbo with a cigar; he had not had one, he said,
      since he was taken prisoner.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now think what must have been the feelings of the most MERCIFUL OF
      MONARCHS, when he informed his prisoner that, in consequence of King
      Padella&rsquo;s cruel and DASTARDLY BEHAVIOUR to Rosalba, Prince Bulbo must
      instantly be executed! The noble Giglio could not restrain his tears, nor
      could the Grenadiers, nor the officers, nor could Bulbo himself, when the
      matter was explained to him, and he was brought to understand that His
      Majesty&rsquo;s promise, of course, was ABOVE EVERY THING, and Bulbo must
      submit. So poor Bulbo was led out, Hedzoff trying to console him, by
      pointing out that if he had won the battle of Bombardaro, he might have
      hanged Prince Giglio. &lsquo;Yes! But that is no comfort to me now!&rsquo; said poor
      Bulbo; nor indeed was it, poor fellow!
    </p>
    <p>
      He was told the business would be done the next morning at eight, and was
      taken back to his dungeon, where every attention was paid to him. The
      gaoler&rsquo;s wife sent him tea, and the turnkey&rsquo;s daughter begged him to write
      his name in her album, where a many gentlemen had written it on like
      occasions! &lsquo;Bother your album!&rsquo; says Bulbo. The Undertaker came and
      measured him for the handsomest coffin which money could buy&mdash;even
      this didn&rsquo;t console Bulbo. The Cook brought him dishes which he once used
      to like; but he wouldn&rsquo;t touch them: he sat down and began writing an
      adieu to Angelica, as the clock kept always ticking, and the hands drawing
      nearer to next morning. The Barber came in at night, and offered to shave
      him for the next day. Prince Bulbo kicked him away, and went on writing a
      few words to Princess Angelica, as the clock kept always ticking, and the
      hands hopping nearer and nearer to next morning. He got up on the top of a
      hatbox, on the top of a chair, on the top of his bed, on the top of his
      table, and looked out to see whether he might escape as the clock kept
      always ticking and the hands drawing nearer, and nearer, and nearer.
    </p>
    <p>
      But looking out of the window was one thing, and jumping another: and the
      town clock struck seven. So he got into bed for a little sleep, but the
      gaoler came and woke him, and said, &lsquo;Git up, your Royal Ighness, if you
      please, it&rsquo;s TEN MINUTES TO EIGHT!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      So poor Bulbo got up: he had gone to bed in his clothes (the lazy boy),
      and he shook himself, and said he didn&rsquo;t mind about dressing, or having
      any breakfast, thank you; and he saw the soldiers who had come for him.
      &lsquo;Lead on!&rsquo; he said; and they led the way, deeply affected; and they came
      into the courtyard, and out into the square, and there was King Giglio
      come to take leave of him, and His Majesty most kindly shook hands with
      him, and the &lsquo;Take off that marched on:&mdash;when hark!
    </p>
    <p>
      Haw&mdash;wurraw&mdash;wurraw&mdash;aworr!
    </p>
    <p>
      A roar of wild beasts was heard. And who should come riding into the town,
      frightening away the boys, and even the beadle and policeman, but ROSALBA!
    </p>
    <p>
      The fact is, that when Captain Hedzoff entered into the court of
      Snapdragon Castle, and was discoursing with King Padella, the lions made a
      dash at the open gate, gobbled up the six beef-eaters in a jiffy, and away
      they went with Rosalba on the back of one of them, and they carried her,
      turn and turn about, till they came to the city where Prince Giglio&rsquo;s army
      was encamped.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the KING heard of the QUEEN&rsquo;S arrival, you may think how he rushed
      out of his breakfast-room to hand Her Majesty off her lion! The lions were
      grown as fat as pigs now, having had Hogginarmo and all those beefeaters,
      and were so tame, anybody might pat them.
    </p>
    <p>
      While Giglio knelt (most gracefully) and helped the Princess, Bulbo, for
      his part, rushed up and kissed the lion. He flung his arms round the
      forest monarch; he hugged him, and laughed and cried for joy. &lsquo;Oh, you
      darling old beast, oh, how glad I am to see you, and the dear, dear Bets&mdash;that
      is, Rosalba.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What, is it you? poor Bulbo!&rsquo; said the Queen.&rsquo; Oh, how glad I am to see
      you,&rsquo; and she gave him her hand to kiss. King Giglio slapped him most
      kindly on the back, and said, &lsquo;Bulbo, my boy, I am delighted, for your
      sake, that Her Majesty has arrived.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So am I,&rsquo; said Bulbo; &lsquo;and YOU KNOW WHY.&rsquo; Captain Hedzoff here came up.
      &lsquo;Sire, it is half-past eight: shall we proceed with the execution?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Execution! what for?&rsquo; asked Bulbo.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;An officer only knows his orders,&rsquo; replied Captain Hedzoff, showing his
      warrant, on which His Majesty King Giglio smilingly said, &lsquo;Prince Bulbo
      was reprieved this time,&rsquo; and most graciously invited him to breakfast.

    <h2>
      XVII. HOW A TREMENDOUS BATTLE TOOK PLACE, AND WHO WON IT
    </h2>
    <p>
      As soon as King Padella heard, what we know already, that his victim, the
      lovely Rosalba, had escaped him, His Majesty&rsquo;s fury knew no bounds, and he
      pitched the Lord Chancellor, Lord Chamberlain, and every officer of the
      Crown whom he could set eyes on, into the cauldron of boiling oil prepared
      for the Princess. Then he ordered out his whole army, horse, foot, and
      artillery; and set forth at the head of an innumerable host, and I should
      think twenty thousand drummers, trumpeters, and fifers.
    </p>
    <p>
      King Giglio&rsquo;s advance guard, you may be sure, kept that monarch acquainted
      with the enemy&rsquo;s dealings, and he was in nowise disconcerted. He was much
      too polite to alarm the Princess, his lovely guest, with any unnecessary
      rumours of battles impending; on the contrary, he did everything to amuse
      and divert her; gave her a most elegant breakfast, dinner, lunch, and got
      up a ball for her that evening, when he danced with her every single
      dance.

    <p>
      Poor Bulbo was taken into favour again, and allowed to go quite free now.
      He had new clothes given him, was called &lsquo;My good cousin&rsquo; by His Majesty,
      and was treated with the greatest distinction by everybody. But it was
      easy to see he was very melancholy. The fact is, the sight of Betsinda,
      who looked perfectly lovely in an elegant new dress, set poor Bulbo
      frantic in love with her again. And he never thought about Angelica, now
      Princess Bulbo, whom he had left at home, and who, as we know, did not
      care much about him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The King, dancing the twenty-fifth polka with Rosalba, remarked with
      wonder the ring she wore; and then Rosalba told him how she had got it
      from Gruffanuff, who no doubt had picked it up when Angelica flung it
      away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; says the Fairy Blackstick, who had come to see the young people,
      and who had very likely certain plans regarding them. &lsquo;That ring I gave
      the Queen, Giglio&rsquo;s mother, who was not, saving your presence, a very wise
      woman; it is enchanted, and whoever wears it looks beautiful in the eyes
      of the world, I made poor Prince Bulbo, when he was christened, the
      present of a rose which made him look handsome while he had it; but he
      gave it to Angelica, who instantly looked beautiful again, whilst Bulbo
      relapsed into his natural plainness.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Rosalba needs no ring, I am sure,&rsquo; says Giglio, with a low bow. &lsquo;She is
      beautiful enough, in my eyes, without any enchanted aid.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, sir!&rsquo; said Rosalba.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Take off the ring and try,&rsquo; said the King, and resolutely drew the ring
      off her finger. In HIS eyes she looked just as handsome as before!
    </p>
    <p>
      The King was thinking of throwing the ring away, as it was so dangerous
      and made all the people so mad about Rosalba; but being a Prince of great
      humour, and good humour too, he cast eyes upon a poor youth who happened
      to be looking on very disconsolately, and said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Bulbo, my poor lad! come and try on this ring. The Princess Rosalba makes
      it a present to you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The magic properties of this ring were uncommonly strong, for no sooner
      had Bulbo put it on, but lo and behold, he appeared a personable,
      agreeable young Prince enough&mdash;with a fine complexion, fair hair,
      rather stout, and with bandy legs; but these were encased in such a
      beautiful pair of yellow morocco boots that nobody remarked them. And
      Bulbo&rsquo;s spirits rose up almost immediately after he had looked in the
      glass, and he talked to their Majesties in the most lively, agreeable
      manner, and danced opposite the Queen with one of the prettiest maids of
      honour, and after looking at Her Majesty, could not help saying&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How very odd! she is very pretty, but not so EXTRAORDINARILY handsome.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh no, by no means!&rsquo; says the Maid of Honour.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But what care I, dear sir,&rsquo; says the Queen, who overheard them, &lsquo;if YOU
      think I am good-looking enough?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      His Majesty&rsquo;s glance in reply to this affectionate speech was such that no
      painter could draw it. And the Fairy Blackstick said, &lsquo;Bless you, my
      darling children! Now you are united and happy; and now you see what I
      said from the first, that a little misfortune has done you both good. YOU,
      Giglio, had you been bred in prosperity, would scarcely have learned to
      read or write&mdash;you would have been idle and extravagant, and could
      not have been a good King as now you will be. You, Rosalba, would have
      been so flattered, that your little head might have been turned like
      Angelica&rsquo;s, who thought herself too good for Giglio.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;As if anybody could be good enough for HIM,&rsquo; cried Rosalba.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, you, you darling!&rsquo; says Giglio. And so she was; and he was just
      holding out his arms in order to give her a hug before the whole company,
      when a messenger came rushing in, and said, &lsquo;My Lord, the enemy!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To arms!&rsquo; cries Giglio.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, mercy!&rsquo; says Rosalba, and fainted of course.
    </p>
    <p>
      He snatched one kiss from her lips, and rushed FORTH TO THE FIELD of
      battle!
    </p>
    <p>
      The Fairy had provided King Giglio with a suit of armour, which was not
      only embroidered all over with jewels, and blinding to your eyes to look
      at, but was water-proof, gun-proof, and sword-proof; so that in the midst
      of the very hottest battles His Majesty rode about as calmly as if he had
      been a British Grenadier at Alma. Were I engaged in fighting for my
      country, <i>I</i> should like such a suit of armour as Prince Giglio wore;
      but, you know, he was a Prince of a fairy tale, and they always have these
      wonderful things.
    </p>
    <p>
      Besides the fairy armour, the Prince had a fairy horse, which would gallop
      at any pace you pleased; and a fairy sword, which would lengthen and run
      through a whole regiment of enemies at once. With such a weapon at
      command, I wonder, for my part, he thought of ordering his army out; but
      forth they all came, in magnificent new uniforms, Hedzoff and the Prince&rsquo;s
      two college friends each commanding a division, and His Majesty prancing
      in person at the head of them all.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ah! if I had the pen of a Sir Archibald Alison, my dear friends, would I
      not now entertain you with the account of a most tremendous shindy? Should
      not fine blows be struck? dreadful wounds be delivered? arrows darken the
      air? cannon balls crash through the battalions? cavalry charge infantry?
      infantry pitch into cavalry? bugles blow; drums beat; horses neigh; fifes
      sing; soldiers roar, swear, hurray; officers shout out &lsquo;Forward, my men!&rsquo; 
      &lsquo;This way, lads!&rsquo; &lsquo;Give it &lsquo;em, boys!&rsquo; &lsquo;Fight for King Giglio, and the
      cause of right!&rsquo; &lsquo;King Padella for ever!&rsquo; Would I not describe all this, I
      say, and in the very finest language too? But this humble pen does not
      possess the skill necessary for the description of combats. In a word, the
      overthrow of King Padella&rsquo;s army was so complete, that if they had been
      Russians you could not have wished them to be more utterly smashed and
      confounded.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for that usurping monarch, having performed acts of velour much more
      considerable than could be expected of a royal ruffian and usurper, who
      had such a bad cause, and who was so cruel to women,&mdash;as for King
      Padella, I say, when his army ran away, the King ran away too, kicking his
      first general, Prince Punchikoff, from his saddle, and galloping away on
      the Prince&rsquo;s horse, having, indeed, had twenty-five or twenty-six of his
      own shot under him. Hedzoff coming up, and finding Punchikoff down, as you
      may imagine, very speedily disposed of HIM. Meanwhile King Padella was
      scampering off as hard as his horse could lay legs to ground. Fast as he
      scampered, I promise you somebody else galloped faster; and that
      individual, as no doubt you are aware, was the Royal Giglio, who kept
      bawling out, &lsquo;Stay, traitor! Turn, miscreant, and defend thyself! Stand,
      tyrant, coward, ruffian, royal wretch, till I cut thy ugly head from thy
      usurping shoulders!&rsquo; And, with his fairy sword, which elongated itself at
      will, His Majesty kept poking and prodding Padella in the back, until that
      wicked monarch roared with anguish.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he was fairly brought to bay, Padella turned and dealt Prince Giglio
      a prodigious crack over the sconce with his battle-axe, a most enormous
      weapon, which had cut down I don&rsquo;t know how many regiments in the course
      of the afternoon. But, Law bless you! though the blow fell right down on
      His Majesty&rsquo;s helmet, it made no more impression than if Padella had
      struck him with a pat of butter: his battle-axe crumpled up in Padella&rsquo;s
      hand, and the Royal Giglio laughed for very scorn at the impotent efforts
      of that atrocious usurper.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the ill success of his blow the Crim Tartar monarch was justly
      irritated. &lsquo;If,&rsquo; says he to Giglio, &lsquo;you ride a fairy horse, and wear
      fairy armour, what on earth is the use of my hitting you? I may as well
      give myself up a prisoner at once. Your Majesty won&rsquo;t, I suppose, be so
      mean as to strike a poor fellow who can&rsquo;t strike again?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The justice of Padella&rsquo;s remark struck the magnanimous Giglio. &lsquo;Do you
      yield yourself a prisoner, Padella?&rsquo; says he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Of course I do,&rsquo; says Padella.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you acknowledge Rosalba as your rightful Queen, and give up the crown
      and all your treasures to your rightful mistress?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If I must, I must,&rsquo; says Padella, who was naturally very sulky.
    </p>
    <p>
      By this time King Giglio&rsquo;s aides-de-camp had come up, whom His Majesty
      ordered to bind the prisoner. And they tied his hands behind him, and
      bound his legs tight under his horse, having set him with his face to the
      tail; and in this fashion he was led back to King Giglio&rsquo;s quarters, and
      thrust into the very dungeon where young Bulbo had been confined.
    </p>
    <p>
      Padella (who was a very different person in the depth of his distress, to
      Padella, the proud wearer of the Crim Tartar crown), now most
      affectionately and earnestly asked to see his son&mdash;his dear eldest
      boy&mdash;his darling Bulbo; and that good-natured young man never once
      reproached his haughty parent for his unkind conduct the day before, when
      he would have left Bulbo to be shot without any pity, but came to see his
      father, and spoke to him through the grating of the door, beyond which he
      was not allowed to go; and brought him some sandwiches from the grand
      supper which His Majesty was giving above stairs, in honour of the
      brilliant victory which had just been achieved.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I cannot stay with you long, sir,&rsquo; says Bulbo, who was in his best ball
      dress, as he handed his father in the prog, &lsquo;I am engaged to dance the
      next quadrille with Her Majesty Queen Rosalba, and I hear the fiddles
      playing at this very moment.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      So Bulbo went back to the ball-room and the wretched Padella ate his
      solitary supper in silence and tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      All was now joy in King Giglio&rsquo;s circle. Dancing, feasting, fun,
      illuminations, and jollifications of all sorts ensued. The people through
      whose villages they passed were ordered to illuminate their cottages at
      night, and scatter flowers on the roads during the day. They were
      requested, and I promise you they did not like to refuse, to serve the
      troops liberally with eatables and wine; besides, the army was enriched by
      the immense quantity of plunder which was found in King Padella&rsquo;s camp,
      and taken from his soldiers; who (after they had given up everything) were
      allowed to fraternise with the conquerors; and the united forces marched
      back by easy stages towards King Giglio&rsquo;s capital, his royal banner and
      that of Queen Rosalba being carried in front of the troops. Hedzoff was
      made a Duke and a Field-Marshal. Smith and Jones were promoted to be
      Earls; the Crim Tartar Order of the Pumpkin and the Paflagonian decoration
      of the Cucumber were freely distributed by their Majesties to the army.
      Queen Rosalba wore the Paflagonian Ribbon of the Cucumber across her
      riding-habit, whilst King Giglio never appeared without the grand Cordon
      of the Pumpkin. How the people cheered them as they rode along side by
      side! They were pronounced to be the handsomest couple ever seen: that was
      a matter of course; but they really WERE very handsome, and, had they been
      otherwise, would have looked so, they were so happy! Their Majesties were
      never separated during the whole day, but breakfasted, dined, and supped
      together always, and rode side by side, interchanging elegant compliments,
      and indulging in the most delightful conversation. At night, Her Majesty&rsquo;s
      ladies of honour (who had all rallied round her the day after King
      Padella&rsquo;s defeat) came and conducted her to the apartments prepared for
      her; whilst King Giglio, surrounded by his gentlemen, withdrew to his own
      Royal quarters. It was agreed they should be married as soon as they
      reached the capital, and orders were dispatched to the Archbishop of
      Blombodinga, to hold himself in readiness to perform the interesting
      ceremony. Duke Hedzoff carried the message, and gave instructions to have
      the Royal Castle splendidly refurnished and painted afresh. The Duke
      seized Glumboso, the Ex-Prime Minister, and made him refund that
      considerable sum of money which the old scoundrel had secreted out of the
      late King&rsquo;s treasure. He also clapped Valoroso into prison (who, by the
      way, had been dethroned for some considerable period past), and when the
      Ex-Monarch weakly remonstrated, Hedzoff said, &lsquo;A soldier, sir, knows but
      his duty; my orders are to lock you up along with the Ex-King Padella,
      whom I have brought hither a prisoner under guard.&rsquo; So these two Ex-Royal
      personages were sent for a year to the House of Correction, and thereafter
      were obliged to become monks of the severest Order of Flagellants, in
      which state, by fasting, by vigils, by flogging (which they administered
      to one another, humbly but resolutely), no doubt they exhibited a
      repentance for their past misdeeds, usurpations, and private and public
      crimes.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for Glumboso, that rogue was sent to the galleys, and never had an
      opportunity to steal any more.

    <h2>
      XVIII. HOW THEY ALL JOURNEYED BACK TO THE CAPITAL
    </h2>
    <p>
      The Fairy Blackstick, by whose means this young King and Queen had
      certainly won their respective crowns back, would come not unfrequently,
      to pay them a little visit&mdash;as they were riding in their triumphal
      progress towards Giglio&rsquo;s capital&mdash;change her wand into a pony, and
      travel by their Majesties&rsquo; side, giving them the very best advice. I am
      not sure that King Giglio did not think the Fairy and her advice rather a
      bore, fancying it was his own velour and merits which had put him on his
      throne, and conquered Padella: and, in fine, I fear he rather gave himself
      airs towards his best friend and patroness. She exhorted him to deal
      justly by his subjects, to draw mildly on the taxes, never to break his
      promise when he had once given it&mdash;and in all respects to be a good
      King.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A good King, my dear Fairy!&rsquo; cries Rosalba. &lsquo;Of course he will. Break his
      promise! can you fancy my Giglio would ever do anything so improper, so
      unlike him? No! never!&rsquo; And she looked fondly towards Giglio, whom she
      thought a pattern of perfection.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why is Fairy Blackstick always advising me, and telling me how to manage
      my government, and warning me to keep my word? Does she suppose that I am
      not a man of sense, and a man of honour?&rsquo; asks Giglio testily. &lsquo;Methinks
      she rather presumes upon her position.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hush! dear Giglio,&rsquo; says Rosalba. &lsquo;You know Blackstick has been very kind
      to us, and we must not offend her.&rsquo; But the Fairy was not listening to
      Giglio&rsquo;s testy observations, she had fallen back, and was trotting on her
      pony now, by Master Bulbo&rsquo;s side, who rode a donkey, and made himself
      generally beloved in the army by his cheerfulness, kindness, and
      good-humour to everybody. He was eager to see his darling Angelica. He
      thought there never was such a charming being. Blackstick did not tell him
      it was the possession of the magic rose that made Angelica so lovely in
      his eyes. She brought him the very best accounts of his little wife, whose
      misfortunes and humiliations had indeed very greatly improved her; and,
      you see, she could whisk off on her wand a hundred miles in a minute, and
      be back in no time, and so carry polite messages from Bulbo to Angelica,
      and from Angelica to Bulbo, and comfort that young man upon his journey.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the Royal party arrived at the last stage before you reach
      Blombodinga, who should be in waiting, in her carriage there with her lady
      of honour by her side, but the Princess Angelica! She rushed into her
      husband&rsquo;s arms, scarcely stopping to make a passing curtsey to the King
      and Queen. She had no eyes but for Bulbo, who appeared perfectly lovely to
      her on account of the fairy ring which he wore; whilst she herself,
      wearing the magic rose in her bonnet, seemed entirely beautiful to the
      enraptured Bulbo.
    </p>
    <p>
      A splendid luncheon was served to the Royal party, of which the
      Archbishop, the Chancellor, Duke Hedzoff, Countess Gruffanuff, and all our
      friends partook, the Fairy Blackstick being seated on the left of King
      Giglio, with Bulbo and Angelica beside her. You could hear the joy-bells
      ringing in the capital, and the guns which the citizens were firing off in
      honour of their Majesties.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What can have induced that hideous old Gruffanuff to dress herself up in
      such an absurd way? Did you ask her to be your bridesmaid, my dear?&rsquo; says
      Giglio to Rosalba. &lsquo;What a figure of fun Gruffy is!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Gruffy was seated opposite their Majesties, between the Archbishop and the
      Lord Chancellor, and a figure of fun she certainly was, for she was
      dressed in a low white silk dress, with lace over, a wreath of white roses
      on her wig, a splendid lace veil, and her yellow old neck was covered with
      diamonds. She ogled the King in such a manner that His Majesty burst out
      laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Eleven o&rsquo;clock!&rsquo; cries Giglio, as the great Cathedral bell of Blombodinga
      tolled that hour. &lsquo;Gentlemen and ladies, we must be starting. Archbishop,
      you must be at church, I think, before twelve?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We must be at church before twelve,&rsquo; sighs out Gruffanuff in a
      languishing voice, hiding her old face behind her fan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And then I shall be the happiest man in my dominions,&rsquo; cries Giglio, with
      an elegant bow to the blushing Rosalba.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, my Giglio! Oh, my dear Majesty!&rsquo; exclaims Gruffanuff; &lsquo;and can it be
      that this happy moment at length has arrived&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Of course it has arrived,&rsquo; says the King.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&mdash;and that I am about to become the enraptured bride of my adored
      Giglio!&rsquo; continues Gruffanuff. &lsquo;Lend me a smelling-bottle, somebody. I
      certainly shall faint with joy.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;YOU my bride?&rsquo; roars out Giglio.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;YOU marry my Prince?&rsquo; cried poor little Rosalba.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Pooh! Nonsense! The woman&rsquo;s mad!&rsquo; exclaims the King. And all the
      courtiers exhibited by their countenances and expressions, marks of
      surprise, or ridicule, or incredulity, or wonder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I should like to know who else is going to be married, if I am not?&rsquo; 
      shrieks out Gruffanuff. &lsquo;I should like to know if King Giglio is a
      gentleman, and if there is such a thing as justice in Paflagonia? Lord
      Chancellor! my Lord Archbishop! will your Lordships sit by and see a poor,
      fond, confiding, tender creature put upon? Has not Prince Giglio promised
      to marry his Barbara? Is not this Giglio&rsquo;s signature? Does not this paper
      declare that he is mine, and only mine?&rsquo; And she handed to his Grace the
      Archbishop the document which the Prince signed that evening when she wore
      the magic ring, and Giglio drank so much champagne. And the old
      Archbishop, taking out his eyeglasses, read&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;This is to give notice, that I, Giglio, only son of Savio, King of
      Paflagonia, hereby promise to marry the charming Barbara Griselda,
      Countess Gruffanuff, and widow of the late Jenkins Gruffanuff, Esq.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;H&rsquo;m,&rsquo; says the Archbishop, &lsquo;the document is certainly a&mdash;a
      document.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Phoo!&rsquo; says the Lord Chancellor, &lsquo;the signature is not in His Majesty&rsquo;s
      handwriting.&rsquo; Indeed, since his studies at Bosforo, Giglio had made an
      immense improvement in caligraphy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is it your handwriting, Giglio?&rsquo; cries the Fairy Blackstick, with an
      awful severity of countenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Y&mdash;y&mdash;y&mdash;es,&rsquo; poor Giglio gasps out, &lsquo;I had quite
      forgotten the confounded paper: she can&rsquo;t mean to hold me by it. You old
      wretch, what will you take to let me off? Help the Queen, some one&mdash;Her
      Majesty has fainted.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Chop her head off!&rsquo; } exclaim the impetuous &lsquo;Smother the old witch!&rsquo; }
      Hedzoff, the ardent Smith, and &lsquo;Pitch her into the river!&rsquo; } the faithful
      Jones.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Gruffanuff flung her arms round the Archbishop&rsquo;s neck, and bellowed
      out, &lsquo;Justice, justice, my Lord Chancellor!&rsquo; so loudly, that her piercing
      shrieks caused everybody to pause. As for Rosalba, she was borne away
      lifeless by her ladies; and you may imagine the look of agony which Giglio
      cast towards that lovely being, as his hope, his joy, his darling, his all
      in all, was thus removed, and in her place the horrid old Gruffanuff
      rushed up to his side, and once more shrieked out, &lsquo;Justice, justice!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Won&rsquo;t you take that sum of money which Glumboso hid?&rsquo; says Giglio; &lsquo;two
      hundred and eighteen thousand millions, or thereabouts. It&rsquo;s a handsome
      sum.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I will have that and you too!&rsquo; says Gruffanuff.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Let us throw the crown jewels into the bargain,&rsquo; gasps out Giglio.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I will wear them by my Giglio&rsquo;s side!&rsquo; says Gruffanuff.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Will half, three-quarters, five-sixths, nineteen-twentieths, of my
      kingdom do, Countess?&rsquo; asks the trembling monarch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What were all Europe to me without YOU, my Giglio?&rsquo; cries Gruff, kissing
      his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I won&rsquo;t, I can&rsquo;t, I shan&rsquo;t,&mdash;I&rsquo;ll resign the crown first,&rsquo; shouts
      Giglio, tearing away his hand; but Gruff clung to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have a competency, my love,&rsquo; she says, &lsquo;and with thee and a cottage thy
      Barbara will be happy.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Giglio was half mad with rage by this time. &lsquo;I will not marry her,&rsquo; says
      he. &lsquo;Oh, Fairy, Fairy, give me counsel?&rsquo; And as he spoke he looked wildly
      round at the severe face of the Fairy Blackstick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Why is Fairy Blackstick always advising me, and warning me to keep my
      word? Does she suppose that I am not a man of honour?&rdquo;&rsquo; said the Fairy,
      quoting Giglio&rsquo;s own haughty words. He quailed under the brightness of her
      eyes; he felt that there was no escape for him from that awful
      inquisition.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, Archbishop,&rsquo; said he in a dreadful voice, that made his Grace
      start, &lsquo;since this Fairy has led me to the height of happiness but to dash
      me down into the depths of despair, since I am to lose Rosalba, let me at
      least keep my honour. Get up, Countess, and let us be married; I can keep
      my word, but I can die afterwards.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, dear Giglio,&rsquo; cries Gruffanuff, skipping up, &lsquo;I knew, I knew I could
      trust thee&mdash;I knew that my Prince was the soul of honour. Jump into
      your carriages, ladies and gentlemen, and let us go to church at once; and
      as for dying, dear Giglio, no, no:&mdash;thou wilt forget that
      insignificant little chambermaid of a Queen&mdash;thou wilt live to be
      consoled by thy Barbara! She wishes to be a Queen, and not a Queen
      Dowager, my gracious Lord!&rsquo; And hanging upon poor Giglio&rsquo;s arm, and
      leering and grinning in his face in the most disgusting manner, this old
      wretch tripped off in her white satin shoes, and jumped into the very
      carriage which had been got ready to convey Giglio and Rosalba to church.
      The cannons roared again, the bells pealed triple-bobmajors, the people
      came out flinging flowers upon the path of the royal bride and bridegroom,
      and Gruff looked out of the gilt coach window and bowed and grinned to
      them. Phoo! the horrid old wretch!
    </p>

    <h2>
      XIX. AND NOW WE COME TO THE LAST SCENE IN THE PANTOMIME
    </h2>
    <p>
      The many ups and downs of her life had given the Princess Rosalba
      prodigious strength of mind, and that highly principled young woman
      presently recovered from her fainting-fit, out of which Fairy Blackstick,
      by a precious essence which the Fairy always carried in her pocket,
      awakened her. Instead of tearing her hair, crying, and bemoaning herself,
      and fainting again, as many young women would have done, Rosalba
      remembered that she owed an example of firmness to her subjects; and
      though she loved Giglio more than her life, was determined, as she told
      the Fairy, not to interfere between him and justice, or to cause him to
      break his royal word.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I cannot marry him, but I shall love him always,&rsquo; says she to Blackstick;
      &lsquo;I will go and be present at his marriage with the Countess, and sign the
      book, and wish them happy with all my heart. I will see, when I get home,
      whether I cannot make the new Queen some handsome presents. The Crim
      Tartary crown diamonds are uncommonly fine, and I shall never have any use
      for them. I will live and die unmarried like Queen Elizabeth, and, of
      course, I shall leave my crown to Giglio when I quit this world. Let us go
      and see them married, my dear Fairy, let me say one last farewell to him;
      and then, if you please, I will return to my own dominions.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      So the Fairy kissed Rosalba with peculiar tenderness, and at once changed
      her wand into a very comfortable coach-and-four, with a steady coachman,
      and two respectable footmen behind, and the Fairy and Rosalba got into the
      coach, which Angelica and Bulbo entered after them. As for honest Bulbo,
      he was blubbering in the most pathetic manner, quite overcome by Rosalba&rsquo;s
      misfortune. She was touched by the honest fellow&rsquo;s sympathy, promised to
      restore to him the confiscated estates of Duke Padella his father, and
      created him, as he sat there in the coach, Prince, Highness, and First
      Grandee of the Crim Tartar Empire. The coach moved on, and, being a fairy
      coach, soon came up with the bridal procession.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before the ceremony at church it was the custom in Paflagonia, as it is in
      other countries, for the bride and bridegroom to sign the Contract of
      Marriage, which was to be witnessed by the Chancellor, Minister, Lord
      Mayor, and principal officers of state. Now, as the royal palace was being
      painted and furnished anew, it was not ready for the reception of the King
      and his bride, who proposed at first to take up their residence at the
      Prince&rsquo;s palace, that one which Valoroso occupied when Angelica was born,
      and before he usurped the throne.
    </p>
    <p>
      So the marriage party drove up to the palace: the dignitaries got out of
      their carriages and stood aside: poor Rosalba stepped out of her coach,
      supported by Bulbo, and stood almost fainting up against the railings so
      as to have a last look of her dear Giglio. As for Blackstick, she,
      according to her custom, had flown out of the coach window in some
      inscrutable manner, and was now standing at the palace door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Giglio came up the steps with his horrible bride on his arm, looking as
      pale as if he was going to execution. He only frowned at the Fairy
      Blackstick&mdash;he was angry with her, and thought she came to insult his
      misery.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Get out of the way, pray,&rsquo; says Gruffanuff haughtily. &lsquo;I wonder why you
      are always poking your nose into other people&rsquo;s affairs?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Are you determined to make this poor young man unhappy?&rsquo; says Blackstick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To marry him, yes! What business is it of yours? Pray, madam, don&rsquo;t say
      &ldquo;you&rdquo; to a Queen,&rsquo; cries Gruffanuff.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You won&rsquo;t take the money he offered you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You won&rsquo;t let him off his bargain, though you know you cheated him when
      you made him sign the paper?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Impudence! Policemen, remove this woman!&rsquo; cries Gruffanuff. And the
      policemen were rushing forward, but with a wave of her wand the Fairy
      struck them all like so many statues in their places.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You won&rsquo;t take anything in exchange for your bond, Mrs. Gruffanuff,&rsquo; 
      cries the Fairy, with awful severity. &lsquo;I speak for the last time.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No!&rsquo; shrieks Gruffanuff, stamping with her foot. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll have my husband,
      my husband, my husband!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;YOU SHALL HAVE YOUR HUSBAND!&rsquo; the Fairy Blackstick cried; and advancing a
      step, laid her hand upon the nose of the KNOCKER.
    </p>
    <p>
      As she touched it, the brass nose seemed to elongate, the open mouth
      opened still wider, and uttered a roar which made everybody start. The
      eyes rolled wildly; the arms and legs uncurled themselves, writhed about,
      and seemed to lengthen with each twist; the knocker expanded into a figure
      in yellow livery, six feet high; the screws by which it was fixed to the
      door unloosed themselves, and JENKINS GRUFFANUFF once more trod the
      threshold off which he had been lifted more than twenty years ago!
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Master&rsquo;s not at home,&rsquo; says Jenkins, just in his old voice; and Mrs.
      Jenkins, giving a dreadful YOUP, fell down in a fit, in which nobody
      minded her.
    </p>
    <p>
      For everybody was shouting, &lsquo;Huzzay! huzzay!&rsquo; &lsquo;Hip, hip, hurray!&rsquo; &lsquo;Long
      live the King and Queen!&rsquo; &lsquo;Were such things ever seen?&rsquo; &lsquo;No, never, never,
      never!&rsquo; &lsquo;The Fairy Blackstick for ever!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The bells were ringing double peals, the guns roaring and banging most
      prodigiously. Bulbo was embracing everybody; the Lord Chancellor was
      flinging up his wig and shouting like a madman; Hedzoff had got the
      Archbishop round the waist, and they were dancing a jig for joy; and as
      for Giglio, I leave you to imagine what HE was doing, and if he kissed
      Rosalba once, twice&mdash;twenty thousand times, I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t think he
      was wrong.
    </p>
    <p>
      So Gruffanuff opened the hall door with a low bow, just as he had been
      accustomed to do, and they all went in and signed the book, and then they
      went to church and were married, and the Fairy Blackstick sailed away on
      her cane, and was never more heard of in Paflagonia.
    </p>
    <p>
      and here ends the Fireside Pantomime.

&ldquo;Defects,&rdquo; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm&rsquo;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
